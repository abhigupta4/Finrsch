References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to we, us, our, the Company and similar terms refer to AAG and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMR or AMR Corporation refers to the Company
during the period of time prior to its emergence from Chapter 11 and its acquisition of US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group) on December 9, 2013. References to US Airways Group and US Airways, a subsidiary of US
Airways Group, represent the entities during the period of time prior to AAGs internal corporate restructuring on December 30, 2015. References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to
mainline refer to the operations of American only and exclude regional operations.  Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain of the statements contained in this report should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may be identified by words such
as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan, project, could, should, would,
continue, seek, target, guidance, outlook, if current trends continue, optimistic, forecast and other similar words. Such statements include, but are not
limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, estimates and strategies for the future, and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on our current objectives, beliefs
and expectations, and they are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and financial position and timing of certain events to differ materially from the information in the forward-looking statements. These risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described below under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 
All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in Part II, Item
1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. There may be other factors of which we are not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or supplement any forward-looking statement to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such statements other than as required by law.

terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAGs principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways
Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On
December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring
items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue
standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the new
revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the
date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. 
We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost
method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and
apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned
mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard
will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. 
Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying
principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial
application with an option to use certain practical expedients.

We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are
on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to
the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. 
Statement of Cash Flows 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not expected to have
a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new
standard will require all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating
income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost (income).

 4. Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends 
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved six share repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority.
As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other
relevant factors. Our share repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
$512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014, we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost
per share of $39.62.  Our Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during the first quarter of 2017:

2017-1 EETCs 
In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal
amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered
to American through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA, A and B
equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as American issues
additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our condensed
consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not Americans assets.

 (Unaudited)   
As of March 31, 2017, approximately $635 million of the escrowed
proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each
year, with interest payments beginning in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018. The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft. 
Certain information regarding the 2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the remaining

received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with the financing of new aircraft on or following the delivery thereof. Interest and
principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the
aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2016-3 EETCs.  Certain information

 Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2017 
In the first quarter of 2017, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $155 million in connection with the
financing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2027 through 2029.  2017
Other Financing Activities  2013 Credit Facilities 
In March 2017, American and AAG amended the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated October 26, 2015
(which amended and restated the Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated May 21, 2015), pursuant to which we refinanced the $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together with the
$1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate margin from 1.50% to 1.00%. The $1.4 billion
revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Facilities (the 2013 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2017, $1.8 billion of principal was outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings or
letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  6. Income Taxes 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior
taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. We also had approximately
$3.7 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2036 if unused.

Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
 (Unaudited)   
At December 31, 2016, we had an alternative minimum tax credit
carryforward of approximately $339 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the NOLs described above. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. 
7. Fair Value Measurements 
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
We utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Our short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for
valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

 The fair value of our long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses,
based on our current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If our long-term debt was measured at fair value, it would have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

 11. Legal Proceedings 
Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to
the Plan and completed the Merger.  Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims
Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG
common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the
Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the
extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this
proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID)
from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have
announced that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have
been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are
in their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously.

 (Unaudited)   
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit
captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of
the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their
complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely
unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class
action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on
October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and
intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.  DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the
DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the
False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. 
General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in
other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control.
Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part
II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for additional discussion. 
12. Subsequent Event  Dividend
Declaration  In April 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a $0.10 per share dividend for
stockholders of record on May 16, 2017, and payable on May 30, 2017. Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN
AIRLINES, INC.  (Unaudited)  1.
Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of American Airlines,
Inc. (American) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in Americans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. American is the
principal wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways
Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On
December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring
items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue
standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. American will adopt the
new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at
the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. 
American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact its condensed
consolidated financial statements. American currently expects that the new revenue standard will materially impact its liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. American currently
uses the incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require
American to change its policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method.
The new revenue standard will also require American to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. 
Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying
principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial
application with an option to use certain practical expedients.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC. 
(Unaudited)   

American is currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are
on-going and could have a material impact on Americans implementation. Currently, American expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated
balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not expected to have
a material impact on Americans condensed consolidated financial statements.  Retirement Benefits 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new
standard will require all components of Americans net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within
nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 6 for Americans current components of net periodic benefit cost
(income).  2. Special Items, Net

2017-1 EETCs 
In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal
amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered
to American through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA, A and B
equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as American issues
additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its condensed
consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not Americans assets.  As of
March 31, 2017, approximately $635 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the
equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018. The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.  Certain information regarding the
2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the remaining escrowed proceeds of the 2017-1 EETC, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

During the first quarter of 2017, all remaining proceeds of the Series 2016-3
Class AA and Class A (the 2016-3 EETCs), in the amount of $109 million, were used to purchase equipment notes issued by American and, after giving effect to such purchase, all of the proceeds
received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with the financing of new aircraft on or following the delivery thereof. Interest and
principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the
aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2016-3 EETCs.  Certain information
regarding the 2016-3 EETC equipment notes, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

 Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2017 
In the first quarter of 2017, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $155 million in connection with the
financing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2027 through 2029.  2017
Other Financing Activities  2013 Credit Facilities 
In March 2017, American and AAG amended the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated October 26, 2015
(which amended and restated the Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated May 21, 2015), pursuant to which American refinanced the $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together
with the $1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate margin from 1.50% to 1.00%. The
$1.4 billion revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Facilities (the 2013 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2017, $1.8 billion of principal was outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan Facility and there were
no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  4. Income Taxes 
At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from
prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. American is a member of AAGs consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns.
The amount of federal NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $10.5 billion, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. American also
had approximately $3.4 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2034 if unused. 
At December 31, 2016, American had an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $452 million
available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.  In the first quarter of 2017,
American recorded an income tax provision of $148 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the NOLs described above. Substantially all of Americans income before income
taxes is attributable to the United States.

5. Fair Value Measurements 
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
American utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Americans short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active
market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

 The fair value of Americans long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow
analyses, based on Americans current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If Americans long-term debt was measured at fair value, it would have been classified as Level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy.  The carrying value and estimated fair value of Americans long-term debt, including current
maturities, were as follows (in millions):

10. Legal Proceedings 
Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to
the Plan and completed the Merger.  Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims
Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG
common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the
Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To
the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Americans financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of
this proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, American received a Civil Investigative
Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from American, and
other airlines have announced that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ
investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously. 
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group,
Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of
Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as
defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a
fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter,
plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and
expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC. 
(Unaudited)   
DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal Service. In
April 2015, the DOJ informed American of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ
seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False
Claims Act or other statutes. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. 
General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged
in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within Americans
control. Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on American are uncertain but could be
material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for additional discussion.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Part I, Item 2 of this report should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 of AAGs
and Americans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the 2016 Form 10-K). The information contained herein is not a comprehensive
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of AAG and American, but rather updates disclosures made in the 2016 Form 10-K. 
Background  Together with
our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries, principally from our
hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In the first quarter of 2017, approximately 46 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights. 
We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our
operation, to building the best employee relations in the industry and to providing returns for our stockholders. In January 2017, we were named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World, which cited the integration work related to
the Merger, our operational and customer service improvements and the investments we are making in our product.  Financial Overview 
The U.S. Airline Industry 
In the first quarter of 2017, U.S. airlines were impacted by substantially higher fuel prices. Jet fuel prices closely follow
the price of Brent crude oil. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 59% higher in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during the first quarter of
2017 was $54 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $34 per barrel during the first quarter of 2016. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during the quarter between a high of $56 per barrel to a low of $50 per
barrel, and closed the quarter on March 31, 2017 at $52 per barrel. With respect to U.S. airline revenues, industry results were improving but remained mixed due in part to the lingering effects of competitive capacity growth in certain
domestic and international markets.  See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions
could adversely affect our business and Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the
supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.

 See below Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial
Measures and Note 2 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for details on the components of special items. 
Pre-Tax Income and Net Income 
We realized net income of $234 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to net income of $700 million in the
first quarter of 2016. Pre-tax income was $365 million and $1.1 billion in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax
net special items, we recognized pre-tax income of $491 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits due to
wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
Revenue  In the first
quarter of 2017, we reported total operating revenues of $9.6 billion, an increase of $189 million, or 2.0%, as compared to the 2016 period. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $8.2 billion, an increase of $68 million,
or 0.8%, as compared to the 2016 period. The increase in mainline and regional passenger revenues was driven by a 2.4% period-over-period increase in consolidated passenger yields. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.1% and international yields
rose 0.6%, driven by improvement in Latin America. The first quarter of 2017 marks a second consecutive quarter of period-over-period increasing yields, which has not occurred since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Additionally, other revenues increased $111 million primarily due to revenues associated with our loyalty program,
principally new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. Our mainline and regional total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 14.96 cents in the first
quarter of 2017, a 3.1% increase as compared to 14.50 cents in the first quarter of 2016.  Fuel 
Our mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017, which was $472 million, or
37.8%, higher as compared to the 2016 period. This increase was driven by a 40.4% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.70 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.21 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 1.8% decrease in gallons of
fuel consumed.  As of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel
consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our
fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.

Other Costs 
We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic
prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. 
Our 2017 first quarter mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 13.17 cents, an increase of 13.7%, from 11.58 cents in
2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts described above. 
Our 2017 first quarter mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel was 10.48 cents, an increase of 8.9% as compared to the
2016 period, which was also driven by higher salaries, wages and benefits.  For a reconciliation of mainline CASM
excluding special items and fuel, see below Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
Liquidity and Stockholder Returns 
As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.7 billion
in unrestricted cash and investments and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash of $543 million. 
During the first quarter of 2017, we returned $563 million to our stockholders, including quarterly dividend payments of
$51 million and the repurchase of $512 million of common stock, or 11.7 million shares. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned more than $10.2 billion to
stockholders, including $697 million in quarterly dividend payments and $9.5 billion in share repurchases, or 240.0 million shares. In April 2017, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share dividend for stockholders of record
on May 16, 2017, and payable on May 30, 2017.  We continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates
to finance our fleet renewal program. During the first quarter 2017, to finance new aircraft deliveries, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $744 million in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) equipment notes at an average fixed
interest rate of 3.86%, as well as $155 million in other equipment notes, which primarily bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin, averaging 2.63% at March 31, 2017. Additionally, we refinanced a $1.8 billion term
loan facility. See Note 5 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for additional information on our debt obligations. 
As a result of the foregoing factors, we currently have a higher debt level and fewer unencumbered assets than our peers.
Accordingly, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage as well as to protect against an adverse economic shock. Our current plan is to maintain minimum total available liquidity of
$7.0 billion. We were well above that minimum level at March 31, 2017.  Reconciliation of GAAP to
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  We sometimes use financial measures that are
derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or
superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial
measures on a GAAP basis.

The table below presents the reconciliation of pre-tax income (GAAP measure) to pre-tax income excluding special items (non-GAAP measure). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As special
items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude special items allows management an additional tool to better understand our core
operating performance.

 Additionally, the table below presents the reconciliation of mainline operating costs (GAAP
measure) to mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance
and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze our
non-fuel costs and core operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

 Total passenger revenues increased $68 million, or 0.8%, in the first quarter of 2017
from the 2016 period primarily driven by a 2.4% period-over-period increase in consolidated passenger yields. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.1% and international yields rose 0.6%, driven by improvement in Latin America. 
Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport
clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $111 million, or 9.3%, in the first quarter of 2017 from the 2016 period primarily driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, other revenue
associated with our loyalty program was $604 million and $491 million, respectively, of which $530 million and $427 million, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments.
This period-over-period increase was primarily due to revenues associated with our new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. 
Total operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 increased $189 million, or 2.0%, from the 2016 period driven
principally by a 9.3% increase in other revenue as described above. Our mainline and regional TRASM was 14.96 cents in the first quarter of 2017, a 3.1% increase as compared to 14.50 cents in the 2016 period.

 Mainline operating expenses increased $782 million, or 11.7%, in the first quarter of
2017 from the 2016 period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline CASM. 
Mainline CASM 
We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not
presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are
providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. 
The table below presents the reconciliation of mainline operating expenses (GAAP measure) to mainline operating costs
excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of
period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze
our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.  The major components of our
total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):

Significant changes in the components of mainline CASM are as follows: 
 


 

 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM increased 38.6% primarily due to a 40.1% increase in the average price
per gallon of fuel to $1.69 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.20 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 2.8% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed.   


 

 
 Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 8.4% primarily due to increased costs associated with wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
 


 

 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM increased 19.5% as compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to an
increase in the volume of engine overhauls and a shift in timing of maintenance expenses incurred. This shift was driven by the transition to a new flight hour based maintenance contract from a time and materials based contract for certain flight
equipment.   


 

 
 Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 16.1% primarily due to aircraft purchased in connection with
our fleet renewal program.   


 

 
 Other operating expenses per ASM increased 9.0% primarily due to expenses associated with improving our
product offerings, customer experience and operational reliability.  Operating Special Items, Net

 Regional operating expenses increased $141 million, or 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2017
from the 2016 period. The period-over-period increase was primarily due to a $99 million, or 45.2%, increase in fuel costs and a $42 million, or 3.4%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel
increased 41.5% to $1.75 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.24 in the 2016 period, on a 2.6% increase in consumption. The increase in other regional operating expenses was primarily driven by a 3.7% increase in capacity, principally from our
wholly-owned regional carriers. See Note 10 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for further information on regional expenses.

 Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided
relatively nominal returns. Interest income increased $8 million, or 63.6%, principally due to an increase in interest rates, which drove more than a 50 basis point increase in average yields in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016
period.  Interest expense, net increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period
primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with our fleet renewal program.  Income Taxes
 In the first quarter 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our net operating losses (NOLs). Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately
$10.5 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. 
See Note 6 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for additional information on income
taxes.  Americans Results of Operations 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 
American realized pre-tax income of $411 million and $1.1 billion in the
first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $537 million and $1.2 billion in the
first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Americans first quarter 2017
pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits
due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with Americans loyalty
program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $116 million, or 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2017 from the 2016 period primarily driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In
the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, other revenue associated with Americans loyalty program was $604 million and $491 million, respectively, of which $530 million and $427 million, respectively, related to the marketing
component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This period-over-period increase was primarily due to revenues associated with Americans new co-branded credit card agreements that became
effective in the third quarter of 2016.  Total operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 increased
$194 million, or 2.1%, from the 2016 period driven principally by a 9.8% increase in other revenue as described above.

 Mainline operating expenses increased $780 million, or 11.7%, in the first quarter of
2017 from the 2016 period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits. Detailed explanations related to the changes in Americans mainline operating expenses are as
follows:   


 

 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 36.2% primarily due to a 40.1% increase in the average price per
gallon of fuel to $1.69 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.20 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 2.8% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed.   


 

 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 6.5% primarily due to increased costs associated with wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
 


 

 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 17.5% as compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to an
increase in the volume of engine overhauls and a shift in timing of maintenance expenses incurred. This shift was driven by the transition to a new flight hour based maintenance contract from a time and materials based contract for certain flight
equipment.   


 

 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 14.1% primarily due to aircraft purchased in connection with
Americans fleet renewal program.   


 

 
 Other operating expenses increased 7.0% primarily due to expenses associated with improving our product
offerings, customer experience and operational reliability.

period.  Interest expense, net increased $23 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period
primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with Americans fleet renewal program.

Income Taxes 
In the first quarter 2017, American recorded an income tax provision of $148 million, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of its NOLs. Substantially all of Americans income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion
of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. 
See Note 4 to Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1B for additional information on
income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Liquidity  As of
March 31, 2017, AAG had approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity and $543 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):

 Share Repurchase Programs 
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved six share repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority.
As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other
relevant factors. Our share repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
$512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014, we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost
per share of $39.62.  Cash Dividends Paid

suspended at any time at our discretion.  Sources and Uses of Cash 
AAG 
Operating Activities 
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion for the first three months of 2017
and 2016, respectively, a period-over-period decrease of $370 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower profitability in the first quarter of 2017 driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.

Table of Contents
Investing Activities 
Our net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the first three months of 2017 and
2016, respectively.  Our principal investing activities in the 2017 period included expenditures of $1.7 billion for
property and equipment, primarily 22 aircraft, including eight Airbus A321 aircraft, five Embraer 175 aircraft, five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and four Boeing 787 aircraft. We also had $262 million in net
purchases of short-term investments.  Our principal investing activities in the 2016 period included expenditures of
$1.6 billion for property and equipment, primarily 28 aircraft, including seven Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Airbus A321 aircraft, six Embraer 175 aircraft, five Boeing 737-800 aircraft, two Boeing 787
aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft. We also had $565 million in net purchases of short-term investments.  Financing Activities
 Our net cash used in financing activities was $349 million and $401 million for the first three months of
2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our principal financing activities in the 2017 period included proceeds of $899 million
from the issuance of debt, primarily including the issuance of $744 million of EETCs. These cash inflows were offset in part by $686 million in debt repayments, $484 million in share repurchases and $51 million in dividend
payments.  Our principal financing activities in the 2016 period included proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance
of debt, primarily including the issuance of $1.1 billion of EETCs. These cash inflows were offset in part by $1.5 billion in share repurchases, $310 million in debt repayments and $61 million in dividend payments. 
American 
Operating Activities 
Americans net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion for the first three
months of 2017 and 2016, respectively, a period-over-period increase of $662 million. We have the ability to move funds freely between our subsidiaries to support our cash requirements. The increase in operating cash flows during the first
quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period was primarily due to a decrease in intercompany cash transfers from American to AAG. This increase in operating cash flows was offset in part by lower profitability driven by higher fuel costs as well
as salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.

Commitments  Significant
Indebtedness  As of March 31, 2017, AAG and American had $24.8 billion and $23.0 billion,
respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities of $1.7 billion each). During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there have been no material changes in our significant indebtedness as discussed in our
2016 Form 10-K, except as discussed in Note 5 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A and Note 3 to Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,
Item 1B.  Collateral Related Covenants 
Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to annually appraise the related
collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such
financing, in whole or in part. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the collateral coverage tests for the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2014 Credit Facilities, the April 2016 Credit Facilities and the December 2016 Credit Facilities
as of the most recent measurement dates.  Credit Ratings 
The following table details AAG and Americans credit ratings as of March 31, 2017:

 The credit agency does not rate this category for
American.  A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would
increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which
could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our
indebtedness.

 On April 24, 2017, American and Airbus entered into
an agreement to revise the delivery schedule of the A350s, and such revised delivery schedule is reflected in the table above. Previously, the delivery schedule for the A350s was two in 2018, five in 2019, five in 2020, five in 2021 and five in
2022. The future payments in the Contractual Obligations table below also reflect this agreement. See Item 5. Other Information. 


(2)
 Reflects an agreement with Boeing reached in April 2017
to defer the delivery of two B787 family aircraft from 2018 to 2019. The future payments in the Contractual Obligations table below also reflect this agreement. 


(3)
 These aircraft may be operated by wholly-owned regional
subsidiaries or leased to third-party regional carriers which would operate the aircraft under capacity purchase arrangements. 


(4)
 Reflects Americans exercise of options to purchase
four additional aircraft scheduled to be delivered in November and December of 2017. The future payments associated with these aircraft are reflected in the Contractual Obligations table below. 
We also have agreements for 42 spare engines to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. 
As of March 31, 2017, we did not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled
to be delivered through 2017: 14 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, eight Airbus A320 family aircraft, eight Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing
commitments in place for substantially all aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate
successfully for additional discussion.  Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements  An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction,
agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments
classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and
development arrangements with us.  There have been no material changes in our
off-balance sheet arrangements as discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K. 
Labor Contracts 
On April 26, 2017, we offered a mid-contract hourly base pay rate adjustment for our flight attendants and pilots of an average
of approximately 5% and 8%, respectively. We estimate that the impact on our salary and benefits expense would be approximately $230 million for 2017 and $350 million for 2018 and 2019. The amendable dates for these workgroups are December 2019
(flight attendants) and January 2020 (pilots).

 Amounts represent contractual amounts due. Excludes $231 million and $12 million of unamortized debt
discount, premium and issuance costs as of March 31, 2017 for American and AAG Parent, respectively. For additional information, see Note 5 and Note 3 to AAGs and Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,
Items 1A and 1B. 


(2) 
 For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at
March 31, 2017. 


(3) 
 Includes $11.2 billion of future principal payments and $2.8 billion of future interest payments,
respectively, as of March 31, 2017, related to EETC notes associated with mortgage financings for the purchase of certain aircraft. 


(4) 
 See Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about these obligations. 


(5) 
 Includes $1.3 billion of future minimum lease payments related to EETC leverage leased financings of
certain aircraft as of March 31, 2017. 


(6) 
 Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These
commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. 


(7) 
 Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and retiree medical and other
postretirement benefit payments and is based on estimated payments through 2026. The total pension contribution of $279 million for the remainder of 2017 assumes a supplemental contribution of $254 million in addition to the
$25 million minimum required contribution. 


(8) 
 Includes a $200 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines, the closing of which is dependent
upon obtaining regulatory and other approvals.  Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions 
In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft, the servicing and amortization
of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, as well as future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into
leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to
cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease
outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a
general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing
arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. 
  45 


Table of Contents
In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our
debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other
considerations, we may continue to take such actions.  Our Board of Directors, has from time to time authorized programs
to repurchase shares of our common stock, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.  Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  In the first quarter of 2017, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from
those disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our 2016 Form 10-K. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See Note 1 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A and Note 1 to Americans Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1B for further information on recent accounting pronouncements.   


ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  AAG and
Americans Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions  Our primary market risk exposures include the
price of aircraft fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk. Our exposure to these market risks has not changed materially from our exposure discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K except as updated
below.  Aircraft Fuel 
As of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and
assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we
review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Our 2017 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption is presently approximately 4.3 billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one cent per gallon
increase in aviation fuel price would result in a $43 million increase in annual expense.  Foreign Currency 
We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated
operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. 
Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect
the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be,
adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.

Interest 
Our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest
expense from variable-rate debt instruments and our interest income from short-term investments. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our March 31, 2017 variable-rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual
interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $96 million and annual interest income on short-term investments would increase by approximately $69 million. 
 


ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. An evaluation of the effectiveness of AAGs and Americans disclosure
controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of AAGs and Americans management, including AAGs and Americans Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO). Based on that evaluation, AAGs and Americans management, including AAGs and Americans CEO and CFO, concluded that AAGs and Americans disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
March 31, 2017.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
On December 9, 2013, AAG acquired US Airways Group and its subsidiaries. We are still in the process of integrating
certain processes, technology and operations for the post-Merger combined company, and we will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to our internal control over financial reporting. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there
has been no change in AAGs or Americans internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AAGs and Americans internal control over financial reporting. 
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Controls 
We believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the
objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO of AAG and American believe that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2017.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 


ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011,
AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date,
December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger. 
Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common
stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed
Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, we are not
required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares
remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this
proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID)
from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have
announced that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have
been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are
in their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously.  Private Party Antitrust Action.
On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US
Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well
as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class
action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. We believe
this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.  DOJ Investigation Related to
the United States Postal Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we
received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating
potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation.

General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we
and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are
uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for
additional discussion.   


ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS  Below are certain risk factors that may affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment,
and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination
thereof, may impact our business.  Risks Relating to AAG and Industry-Related Risks 
Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. 
Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline
industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger
demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. See also The airline industry is intensely
competitive and dynamic below.  Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued
periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity. 
Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel,
which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile. 
Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of
fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares,
impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Similarly, we cannot predict the effect or the actions of our competitors if the current low fuel prices remain in place for a significant period of
time or fuel prices decrease in the future.  Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel,
we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental
policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and
other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. 
Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs.
Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to
time based on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we
will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.  If in the future we enter into derivative contracts to
hedge our fuel consumption, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our
derivative contracts. To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs
in the future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could materially adversely impact our short-term liquidity, because hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral
in the form of cash or letters of credit. See also the discussion in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Aircraft Fuel.

Table of Contents
The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic. 
Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures
formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with
at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities and promotions, which can have a substantial
adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute
pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability. 
Low-cost carriers, including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from
larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently and are price sensitive and tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. A number of
low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost
carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. For example, as a result of divestitures completed in
connection with gaining regulatory approval for the Merger, low-fare, low-cost carriers have gained additional access in a number of markets, including Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport (DCA), a slot-controlled airport. In addition, we and several other large network carriers have announced basic economy fares designed to compete against low-cost
carriers and we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful or the competitive reaction of the low-cost carriers. The actions of the low-cost carriers,
including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.  Our
presence in international markets is not as extensive as that of some of our competitors. In providing international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations with
U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines, including carriers based in the Middle East, the three largest of which we believe benefit from significant government subsidies. Our international
service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand, such as we have recently experienced in Brazil and Venezuela, when any foreign countries we serve suffer adverse local economic conditions. In addition, open skies
agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets. See also Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our
costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. 
Certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from
antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively
compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to
maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.  We are party to
antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Royal Jordanian, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines and LAN Peru. As part of the antitrust-immunized relationships, we have also established joint business agreements (JBAs)
with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and separately with Japan Airlines. We signed a revised JBA with Qantas Airways and applied for antitrust immunity with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the revised relationship, but we
withdrew that application in November 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the DOT. However, we expect that our existing, more limited cooperation with Qantas will continue, and we intend to file a new application for antitrust immunity with the
DOT this year. In addition, we have signed JBAs with certain air carriers of the LATAM Airlines Group and have applied for approval in the relevant jurisdictions affected by such agreements, which applications are still pending before the relevant
regulators. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance of the other airlines party to those agreements. No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from
such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented.

Table of Contents
Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust
immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive
position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth
will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in
Europe and elsewhere.  Ongoing data security requirements and obligations could increase our costs, and any significant data security
incident could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer, employee, business partner and other sensitive
information, and confidence in the networks and systems that allow us to operate. We cannot be certain that we will not be the target of attacks on our networks and intrusions into our data, particularly given recent advances in technical
capabilities, and increased financial and political motivations to carry out cyber-attacks on physical systems, gain unauthorized access to information, and make information unavailable for use through, for example, ransomware or denial-of-service attacks, and otherwise exploit new and existing vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. The risk of a data security incident or disruption, particularly
through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
Furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on attacks on critical infrastructures, including those in the transportation sector, and on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in
the European Union (EU)), including requirements for varying levels of data subject notification in the event of a data security incident. 
In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we
must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these
standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.  A
significant data security incident or our failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data security regulations or other data security standards may impact our brand and expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, resulting in
fines, sanctions or other penalties. Such actions could further harm our reputation, adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees, and stockholders, result in material financial impact, and disrupt business operations. Failure to
appropriately address these issues could also give rise to similar legal risks and damages.  Our high level of debt and other
obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry
conditions.  We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations,
obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a
substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they: 
 


 

 
 may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness; 
 


 

 
 may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
investments, integration costs, and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;   


 

 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness
and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;   


 

 
 make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events,
particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage; 
  51 


Table of Contents


 

 
 contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and
cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities;   


 

 
 contain restrictive covenants that could: 
 


 

 
 limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock,
make investments and pay dividends;   


 

 
 significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own
operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; 
 


 

 
 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions; and   


 

 
 result in an event of default under our indebtedness. 
Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London
interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and the supply of and demand for credit in
the London interbank market. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the
extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be
adversely affected. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest. 
These obligations also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our
business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.  We
will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.  Our business plan contemplates
significant investments in modernizing our fleet. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of March 31, 2017, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase
commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2017-2021 would be approximately $13.1 billion. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft. If we are unable to
arrange financing for such aircraft at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft with
the aircraft manufacturers. Depending on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets view of our prospects and the airline industry in general,
and the general availability of debt and equity capital at the time we seek capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no
assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.  We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may
adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.  Our pension funding obligations
are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our
pension plans is subject to favorable temporary funding rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Our minimum pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially beginning in 2019, when we will be required to make
contributions relating to the 2018 fiscal year. In addition, we may have significant obligations for other postretirement benefits, the ultimate amount of which depends on, among other things, the outcome of an adversary proceeding related to
retiree medical and other postretirement benefits and life insurance obligations filed in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
  52 


Table of Contents
If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other
commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.  We have agreements with companies that process customer
credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of American to maintain certain levels of
liquidity) to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently
required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in
our financial condition. An increase in the current holdbacks, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, could materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other
entities to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. 
Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations. 
Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA,
collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain amendable dates rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a
multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB). For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item 1. Business 
Employees and Labor Relations in our 2016 Form 10-K.  In the
case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation
and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration
to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day cooling off period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential
Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day cooling off
period. At the end of a cooling off period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise self-help, such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.  None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully
engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more
concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. See also Part I, Item 1. Business  Employees and Labor Relations in our 2016 Form 10-K.  The inability to maintain labor costs at competitive levels would harm our
financial performance.  Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network
carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because some of our agreements are amendable now and others may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may
agree to higher-cost provisions in our current or future labor negotiations, such as the employee profit sharing program we instituted effective January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of our employees were represented
for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. Unions may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to
engage in bargaining processes where we believe we have no such obligation. If successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could create material additional costs that we did not anticipate. 
Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
We operate principally through hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia,
Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs resulting from air traffic control (ATC) delays, weather
conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, relations with third-party service providers, failure of computer systems, disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations, labor relations, power
supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities, or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and
infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.
 In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or
existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas, operations control facilities and office space. As airports around the world become more
congested, we are not always able to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including due to inadequate facilities at desirable
airports. Further, our operating costs at airports at which we operate, including our hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that we may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. In some circumstances,
such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval.  In addition, operations at three
major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct
operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) currently regulates the allocation of slots or slot exemptions at DCA and two New York City airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport (LGA). In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and
DCA are also limited based on the stage length of the flight. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority. Similarly, our operations at international airports in Beijing, Frankfurt,
London Heathrow, Paris, Tokyo and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the International Airline Trade Association (IATA) Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have
sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. However, there is no assurance that we will be
able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental
policies. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago OHare International Airport (ORD) and
Los Angeles International Airport, where the airport gate and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.
 Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, operations
control facilities, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations
could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.  A
significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, primarily under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risks
of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain necessary personnel, including in
particular pilots, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. Many of these third-party regional
operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Volatility in fuel prices, disruptions to capital markets and adverse economic
conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have led to several bankruptcies among these operators. For example, one of our significant third-party operators of
regional capacity, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (Republic), commenced a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on February 25, 2016. As part of Republics restructuring process and with bankruptcy court approval, we entered into an amendment to our
contractual relationship with Republic that, among other things, provided for the reduction in the number of aircraft operated by Republic on our behalf to 76 E175 aircraft (a reduction of 20 E170 and nine E175 aircraft). In addition, we have
reached a settlement with Republic that has resulted in the allowance of an unsecured claim on behalf of American, to compensate us in part for losses and damages that we incurred under the existing contract with Republic. This claim is expected to
be settled in the form of common stock representing an approximate 25% ownership interest in the restructured company. It is not possible, at this point, however, to quantify the value of a recovery on such claim. We may also experience disruption
to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of
our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including
distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities, reservations and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into
in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no
guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We rely on
third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels. 
We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (GDSs) (e.g.,
Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (OTAs) (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and The Priceline Group), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and
we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels and hope to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at
present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our call centers and our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute
our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an
industry-competitive cost structure. These imperatives may affect our relationships with GDSs and OTAs, including as consolidation of OTAs continues or is proposed to continue, and require us to make significant investments in potential new
distribution technologies. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business is subject to extensive government
regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. 
Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has
passed laws, and the DOT, the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial
costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.  For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives
and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to
efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft. Additionally, our failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In the future, new regulatory
requirements could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.  DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010
require procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares
and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international
airlines.

Table of Contents
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of
certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Present and
potential future security requirements can have the effect of imposing costs and inconvenience on travelers, potentially reducing the demand for air travel. 
The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by
changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:   


 

 
 changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at
particular airports, or the types of fees that can be charged to passengers;   


 

 
 the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government
approvals) needed for codesharing alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines;   


 

 
 restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would
curtail an airlines ability to respond to a competitor);   


 

 
 the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards (for
example, a passenger bill of rights);   


 

 
 restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or
reallocation of slot rights currently held by us; and   


 

 
 the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. 
Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline
operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us. 
Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the U.S. or overseas could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the United States National Airspace System (the ATC system) is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic
controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that are routinely overwhelmed and compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. The ATC systems inability to handle existing travel demand has led
government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. The outdated technologies also cause the ATC to be less
resilient in the event of a failure. For example, in 2014 the ATC systems in Chicago took weeks to recover following a fire in the ATC tower at ORD, which resulted in thousands of cancelled flights. 
The FAA has embarked on transforming the national airspace system, to include migration from the current radar-based air
traffic control system to a GPS-based system. This ATC modernization, generally referred to as NextGen, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains uncertain when the full array of
benefits expected from ATC modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements that may be imposed on airlines of a modernized ATC system may
have a material adverse effect on our business. We support legislative efforts that would establish a nimble not-for-profit entity better suited to manage the long-term
investments in technology and provide a governance structure needed to successfully implement NextGen and improve the operation of the air traffic control system. 
Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective
countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction
and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are subject to periodic renegotiation. We currently operate a number of international routes
under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy
were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing
joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took
effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each others markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU, including London Heathrow Airport (LHR).
As a result of the agreement, we face increased competition in these markets, including LHR. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route
authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The U.S. government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access
between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.

The airline industry is heavily taxed. 
The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability.
The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For
example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees
and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the ticket tax, on domestic and international air
transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although
these taxes and fees are not operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on
airlines and their passengers, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers.
Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus
our revenues.  Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may
cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.  We have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the
future, changes to our business model to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include premium economy service, basic economy service and charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket
and increasing other pre-existing fees. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure you that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational
performance of our airline. Also, any new and increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel
costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges. 
The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified
personnel could adversely affect our business.  We believe that our future success will depend in large part on
our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant
numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing
security concerns.  Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars
or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and attempted attacks
materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of September 11, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs
for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security
screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and enhanced
background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul
travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. Implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers, and have
caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. We have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on
our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. As a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput to support the pace of our operations, it is unlikely that we will be
able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business.

We operate a global business with international operations that are
subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control. 
We operate a global business with operations outside of the U.S. Our current international activities and prospects have been
and in the future could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market,
exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international
government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. In particular, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the
repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. 
Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect
the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.  The United Kingdom held a referendum in June 2016 regarding its membership in the EU in which a
majority of the United Kingdom electorate voted in favor of the British government taking the necessary action for the United Kingdom to leave the EU. In March 2017, the United Kingdom served notice of its decision to withdraw to the EU, formally
initiating the withdrawal process. Serving this notice began the two-year period for the United Kingdom to negotiate the terms for its withdrawal from the EU. At this time, it is not certain what steps will
need to be taken to facilitate the United Kingdoms exit from the EU. The implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the EU are similarly unclear at present because it is unclear what relationship the United Kingdom will have with the
EU after withdrawal. We face risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum and the consequences that may flow from the decision to exit the EU. Among other things, the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could adversely affect
European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. In addition, the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially
divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other
matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. The impact on our business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing EU counterparts cannot be
predicted. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.
 We are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances
relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste
materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. 
  58 


Table of Contents
We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those
that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for
investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental
contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business.  We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and
other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, in some cases even if we are not
the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the
participating airlines.  Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already
implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be
adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.  We are subject to risks
associated with climate change, including increased regulation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  There is
increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, in October 2016, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) passed a resolution adopting the ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for
International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA was supported by the board of Airlines For America (the principal U.S. airline trade association)
and IATA (the principal international airline trade association), and by American and many other U.S. and foreign airlines. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines, including other U.S. airlines that operate
internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should help to ensure that these costs will be more predictable and more evenly applied to American and its competitors. The CORSIA is
expected to be implemented in phases, beginning in 2021. Certain details still need to be developed and the impact of the CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. While we do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2017,
compliance with the CORSIA or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs beyond 2017. Further, the potential impact of the CORSIA or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately
depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets and the number of future flights subject to such emissions-related requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could
fluctuate.  In addition, in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCCs COP21), over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. While there is no express reference to aviation in this international agreement, to
the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries such as the aviation fuel industry, it could
have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued an
endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which is a precursor to EPA regulation of aircraft engine GHG emission standards.
It is anticipated that any such standards established by the EPA would closely align with emission standards currently being developed by ICAO. In February 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended that ICAO adopt
carbon dioxide certification standards that would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023. 
In addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the
planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations, or the operations of our suppliers, may be subject to additional
operating and other permit requirements, likely resulting in increased operating costs.

These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and
state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the
future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including
fuel costs.  We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these
technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are highly
dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems,
telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of
traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets.
We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our automated systems are not functioning or if our
third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our
business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised,
replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. 
Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against other events that are beyond our control, including natural
disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in
our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these systems
could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems. 
Among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer,
communications and other technology systems that will be necessary to operate US Airways and American as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses. While we have to date successfully integrated
several of our systems, including our customer reservations system and our pilot and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration projects. The integration of these systems in a number of prior
airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecast. The implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware,
software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.  We cannot
assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could
result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident, accident involving our personnel or
aircraft or the personnel or aircraft of our regional or codeshare operators.  If our personnel or one of our
aircraft, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident,
accident or catastrophe, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident or catastrophe. In the event that our
insurance is inapplicable or not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident accident or catastrophe involving our personnel or one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of
our regional operators and our codeshare partners) could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners,
and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet
capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate.
In many cases, the aircraft we intend to operate are not yet in our fleet, but we have contractual commitments to purchase or lease them. If for any reason we were unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled
delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some
leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in
increased maintenance costs. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with
respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. 
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. As a result, we
are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in
customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.  Our business has been
and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. 
Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing
economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:   


 

 
 actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial
conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;   


 

 
 changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends; 
 


 

 
 changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance
affiliations, and other factors;   


 

 
 actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems; 
 


 

 
 increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures; 
 


 

 
 outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and 
 


 

 
 weather and natural disasters. 
In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing
revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition,
due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.

Table of Contents
A higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time
regulations, increased flight hour requirements for commercial airline pilots and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots which could materially adversely affect our business. 
We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Among other things, the extension of pilot
careers facilitated by the FAAs 2007 modification of the mandatory retirement age from age 60 to age 65 has now been fully implemented, resulting in large numbers of pilots in the industry approaching the revised mandatory retirement age.
Further, in July 2013, the FAA issued regulations that increased the flight hours required for pilots working for airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. In addition, on January 4, 2014, more stringent pilot
flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation Regulations took effect. These and other factors, including reductions in the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial
pilots upon their retirement from military service, have contributed to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required
by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. The foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers to hire
pilots to replace retiring pilots. We believe that this industry-wide pilot shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the United States. Our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet
their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a
material adverse effect on our business.  Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
adversely impact our operations and financial results.  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a
significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current
prices remains uncertain. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the
claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to
pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position
and liquidity.  From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and
government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not
yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not
within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in
significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or
types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain
legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  Our ability to utilize
our NOL Carryforwards may be limited.  Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a
corporation is generally allowed a deduction for NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2016, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $10.5 billion for regular federal income tax
purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022, and approximately $3.7 billion for state income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, between 2017 and 2036. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal
Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.

Table of Contents
A corporations ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to
utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an ownership change as defined in Section 382
(generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and US Airways
Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain
special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $8.9 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December 31, 2016) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the
annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL
Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries) are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained
as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect
on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation) contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the
ability of certain holders of AAG common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership
change will not occur even with these restrictions in place.  Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on
the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them. 
We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never
realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges. 
Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually. In accordance with applicable accounting
standards, we are required to assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In addition, we are required to assess certain of our
other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.  Future impairment of
goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of
goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result
from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The price of AAG common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile. 
The market price of AAG common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our
control, including:   


 

 
 AAGs operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or
investors;   


 

 
 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; 
 


 

 
 material announcements by us or our competitors; 
 


 

 
 movements in fuel prices; 
 


 

 
 expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including our share repurchase program and any future
dividend payments that may be declared by our Board of Directors;   


 

 
 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;

We cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs or continue to
pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.
 Since July 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our Board of Directors has approved six share
repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority. As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs
may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any
specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions,
applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase programs may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
Although our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in July 2014 as part of our capital deployment
program, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed
period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends
based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will be able to pay dividends
in the future.  In addition, repurchases of AAG common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs and any future
dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market
liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase programs and any future dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and
acquisitions. Further, our share repurchase programs may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is
no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness.

Certain provisions of AAGs Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial. 
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) may have the effect of
delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following: 
 


 

 
 advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders meetings;
  


 

 
 the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board; 
 


 

 
 a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent; 
 


 

 
 a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; 
 


 

 
 a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election
of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and   


 

 
 super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of
Incorporation.  These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and
maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to
prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the
Board of Directors prior to the investment under Section 203.  AAGs Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.  Our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include certain provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock and our other
equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of AAG common stock and our other equity interests.

with respect to the Class AA Certificates at the Stated Interest Rate therefor in accordance with Section 3.05(a) and 3.05(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Each Interest Advance made hereunder shall automatically reduce the Maximum Available

the amount of any Interest Advance made pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), together with accrued interest thereon (as provided herein), the Maximum Available Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Interest Advance so
repaid, but not to exceed the Maximum Commitment; provided, however, that, subject to Section 2.06(d), the Maximum Available Commitment shall not be so reinstated at any time if (x) both a Performing Note Deficiency exists and a

(ii)    A Downgrade Advance shall be made by the Liquidity Provider if this Liquidity Facility becomes a Downgraded
Facility following the occurrence of a Downgrade Event (as provided for in Section 3.05(c) of the Intercreditor Agreement), unless (i) a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace this Agreement shall have been previously delivered to the
Borrower within thirty-five (35) days after the Downgrade Event (or, if earlier, the Expiry Date) or (ii) the relevant Rating Agency shall have provided confirmation within thirty (35) days (or, if earlier, the expiration date of such
Downgraded Facility) after the Downgrade Event that such Downgrade Event will not result in a downgrading, withdrawal or suspension by such Rating Agency of the rating then in effect for the related Class of Certificates, in each case of clause
(i) and (ii), in accordance with said Section 3.05(c), by delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex III, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, in

hereof.  (f)    Upon the making of any Advance requested pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing in accordance with the
Borrowers payment instructions, the Liquidity Provider shall be fully discharged of its obligation hereunder with respect to such Notice of Borrowing, and the Liquidity Provider shall not thereafter be obligated to make any further Advances
hereunder in respect of such Notice of Borrowing to the Borrower or to any other Person (including the Class AA Trustee or any Class AA Certificateholder). If the Liquidity Provider makes an Advance requested pursuant to a Notice of
Borrowing before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after the date of payment specified in Section 2.02(e), the Liquidity Provider shall have fully discharged its obligations hereunder with respect to such Advance and an
event of default shall not have occurred hereunder. Following the making of any Advance pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.02(c) or 2.02(d) to fund the Class AA Cash Collateral Account, the Liquidity Provider shall have no interest in or rights to
the Class AA Cash Collateral Account, such Advance or any other amounts from time to time on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account; provided that the foregoing shall not affect or impair the obligations of the
Subordination Agent to make the distributions contemplated by Section 3.05(e) or 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not affect or impair the

  10 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



rights of the Liquidity Provider to provide written instructions with respect to the investment and reinvestment of amounts in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account to the extent provided in
Section 2.02(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement. By paying to the Borrower proceeds of Advances requested by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider makes no representation as to, and assumes no
responsibility for, the correctness or sufficiency for any purpose of the amount of the Advances so made and requested. 
Section 2.03    Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider the fees set forth in the Fee
Letter.  Section 2.04    Reduction or Termination of the Maximum Commitment. (a) Automatic
Reduction. Promptly following each date on which the Required Amount is reduced as a result of a reduction in the Pool Balance of the Class AA Certificates or otherwise, the Maximum Commitment shall automatically be reduced to an amount
equal to such reduced Required Amount (as calculated by the Borrower). The Borrower shall give notice of any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment to the Liquidity Provider and American within two Business Days thereof. The failure by
the Borrower to furnish any such notice shall not affect any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment. 
(b)    Termination. Upon the making of any Provider Advance, Special Termination Advance or Final Advance hereunder
or the occurrence of the Termination Date, the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make further Advances hereunder shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any further Borrowing hereunder,
except in the case of a Downgrade Advance, as provided in Section 2.06(d).  Section 2.05    Repayments of
Interest Advances, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance. Subject to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.09 hereof, the Borrower hereby agrees, without notice of an Advance or demand for repayment from the Liquidity Provider (which notice
and demand are hereby waived by the Borrower), to pay, or to cause to be paid, to the Liquidity Provider (a) on each date on which the Liquidity Provider shall make an Interest Advance, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance, an
amount equal to the amount of such Advance (any such Advance, until repaid, is referred to herein as an Unpaid Advance) (if multiple Interest Advances are outstanding any such repayment to be applied in the order in which
such Interest Advances have been made, starting with the earliest), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the
Liquidity Provider shall make a Provider Advance at any time after making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become a Downgraded
Facility or Non-Extended Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment to zero, then such Interest Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances
and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the
purpose of determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with Section 2.06 and for the purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special
Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class AA Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor 
  11 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Agreement (the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an
Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable
thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance
(including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and,
provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as
a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity
Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity
Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid when due under Section 3.07. 
Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider
Advance shall be deposited in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject
to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider Advance, interest on the principal amount of any
such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying
interest on the Class AA Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an Applied Downgrade
Advance and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and together with an Applied
Downgrade Advance, an Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest
payable thereon; provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance shall
thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the
Class AA Cash Collateral Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus interest on the
principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07.  (b)    At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or
Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class AA 
  12 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause fourth of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor Agreement (any such amount being a Replenishment
Amount) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and Applied Special Termination
Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such
Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount. 
(c)    Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed
to the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not
to exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
 Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In
order to provide for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to
the Liquidity Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of
Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the
Borrower hereunder.  Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances.

Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments
to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the
Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof
after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower in writing before the 25th day prior to an anniversary date of the Closing Date that is
prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class AA Certificates (such notification, a Non-Extension
Notice; the date of such notification, the Notice Date) that its obligation to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the
Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the Notice Date (but prior to such anniversary date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE III  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER  Section 3.01    Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03,
if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation
to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect
thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07
and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider
describing in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower 
  14 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on
the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or
attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this
Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim
in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall
not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to
the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is
effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01:
(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity Providers jurisdiction of
organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated or issued by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and International framework for
liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises
through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving
rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar
increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.

Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to
the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld, (ii) without
duplication of any rights created by Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after
deduction or withholding of all Covered Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a
payment to the relevant authorities furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider,
within 10 Business Days of demand therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto. If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (consistent with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may
thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise
available to it as a result of, any Taxes for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund
(and any interest thereon), net of any related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the
Liquidity Provider the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund
to such governmental or taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which
would place the Liquidity Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax
benefit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
The Liquidity Provider will (i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to
Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S. taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form
or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions 
  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding
of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or
becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of Covered Taxes.  If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be
necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the
holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes.

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have
been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR
Advance) or reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance. 
Section 3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be
paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the
date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class AA Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied
Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class AA Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder
(whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to
but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



amount, as the case may be, as in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the
absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the
circumstances giving 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to
as the Applicable Liquidity Rate.  Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower.
Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective
date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider
by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder. 
Section 3.09    Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the
request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of: 
(1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date for borrowing
specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02.  Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be
converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the
expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is
reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to
lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all
commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any
action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action
is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Section 7.03    No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Liquidity Provider to exercise, and no

shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  Section 7.06    Liability of the Liquidity Provider. (a)

Section 7.08    Binding Effect; Participations. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the

Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Providers right to grant Participations pursuant to Section
7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended and (iii) such Participation shall not be made to any Person that is a commercial air
carrier, American or any affiliate of American. Notwithstanding any such Participation, the Liquidity Provider agrees that (1) the Liquidity Providers obligations under the Operative Agreements shall remain unchanged, and such participant
shall have no rights or benefits as against American or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such
obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its
participants. Accordingly, in determining 
  27 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and
capital adequacy requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are
commercial banking institutions and of whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a
Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the
Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a
Participation, it shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest
in this Agreement.  (c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant
shall (i) represent to the Liquidity Provider (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties, no taxes will be required to be withheld with respect to any income derived by such participant
from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service certifying, in each case, such participants entitlement to a complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered
by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal
withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower)
to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations
of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such
participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is confidential.

Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder.

is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

equal to such reduced Required Amount (as calculated by the Borrower). The Borrower shall give notice of any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment to the Liquidity Provider and American within two Business Days thereof. The failure by

or the occurrence of the Termination Date, the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make further Advances hereunder shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any further Borrowing hereunder,

waived by the Borrower), to pay, or to cause to be paid, to the Liquidity Provider (a) on each date on which the Liquidity Provider shall make an Interest Advance, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance, an amount equal to the
amount of such Advance (any such Advance, until repaid, is referred to herein as an Unpaid Advance) (if multiple Interest Advances are outstanding any such repayment to be applied in the order in which such Interest
Advances have been made, starting with the earliest), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the Liquidity Provider
shall make a Provider Advance at any time after making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become a Downgraded Facility or Non-Extended
Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment to zero, then such Interest Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade
Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the purpose of determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in
accordance with Section 2.06 and for the purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on

(the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an
Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable
thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance
(including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and,
provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as
a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity
Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity
Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid when due under Section 3.07. 
Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider
Advance shall be deposited in the Class A Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to

(z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an
Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon;
provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance shall thereafter be treated
as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the Class A Cash Collateral
Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus interest on the principal amount so repaid as
provided in Section 3.07.  (b) At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion
thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class A

3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class A Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed to
the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to
exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
 Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to provide
for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity
Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II
and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the Borrower
hereunder.  Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances.

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments
to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the

after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class A Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower in writing before the 25th day prior to an anniversary date of the Closing Date that is

Notice; the date of such notification, the Notice Date) that its obligation to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the

ARTICLE III  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER  Section 3.01 Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03, if as a result of any Regulatory
Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation to make any such Advances or
there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect thereof, and in case of either
such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the
Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower
shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail
the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower 
  14 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on
the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or
attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this
Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim
in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall
not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to
the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is
effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01:
(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity Providers jurisdiction of
organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated or issued by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and International framework for
liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises
through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving
rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar
increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.

Section 3.02    Intentionally omitted. 
Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this
Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld, (ii) without duplication of any rights created by
Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered
Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a payment to the relevant authorities
furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider, within 10 Business Days of demand
therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with
applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise available to it as a result of, any Taxes
for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon), net of any
related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the Liquidity Provider the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund to such governmental or taxing
authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which would place the Liquidity
Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax benefit had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to make available its Tax returns (or
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  The Liquidity Provider will
(i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S.
taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions

  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding
of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or
becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of Covered Taxes.  If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be
necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the
holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes.

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to
be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have been made
when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR Advance) or
reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance.  Section
3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date
of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class A
Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class A Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in
respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue
and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



be, as in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law;
provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any
subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the absolute amount of
interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the
circumstances giving 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to
as the Applicable Liquidity Rate.  Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower.
Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective
date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider
by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder. 
Section 3.09    Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the
request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of: 
(1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date for borrowing
specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02.  Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be
converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the
expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is
reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to
such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially
reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any
action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action
is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Whenever the words notice or notify or similar words are used herein, they mean the provision of formal notice as set forth in this Section 7.02. 
Section 7.03    No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Liquidity Provider to exercise, and no

7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that

obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its
participants. Accordingly, in determining

capital adequacy requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are
commercial banking institutions and of whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a
Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the
Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a
Participation, it shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest
in this Agreement.  (c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant

from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form

transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered
by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal
withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower)
to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations
of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such
participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is confidential.

Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 2.03    Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider the fees set forth in the Fee
Letter.  Section 2.04    Reduction or Termination of the Maximum Commitment. (a) Automatic
Reduction. Promptly following each date on which the Required Amount is reduced as a result of a reduction in the Pool Balance of the Class B Certificates or otherwise, the Maximum Commitment shall automatically be reduced to an amount
equal to such reduced Required Amount (as calculated by the Borrower). The Borrower shall give notice of any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment to the Liquidity Provider and American within two Business Days thereof. The failure by
the Borrower to furnish any such notice shall not affect any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment. 
(b)    Termination. Upon the making of any Provider Advance, Special Termination Advance or Final Advance hereunder
or the occurrence of the Termination Date, the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make further Advances hereunder shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any further Borrowing hereunder,

and demand are hereby waived by the Borrower), to pay, or to cause to be paid, to the Liquidity Provider (a) on each date on which the Liquidity Provider shall make an Interest Advance, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance, an
amount equal to the amount of such Advance (any such Advance, until repaid, is referred to herein as an Unpaid Advance) (if multiple Interest Advances are outstanding any such repayment to be applied in the order in which
such Interest Advances have been made, starting with the earliest), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the
Liquidity Provider shall make a Provider Advance at any time after making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become a Downgraded
Facility or Non-Extended Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment to zero, then such Interest Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances
and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the
purpose of determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with Section 2.06 and for the

purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of
paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the
outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining
the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to
Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance (including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable
Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and, provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied
Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange
for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid
when due under Section 3.07.  Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts
advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider Advance shall be deposited in the Class B Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and

Advance, interest on the principal amount of any such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash
Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an
Applied Downgrade Advance and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and
together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable
Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such
Provider Advance shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any
amounts from the Class B Cash Collateral Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus
interest on the principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07.

Applied Special Termination Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by
the amount of such Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount.

3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed to
the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to
exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.

for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity
Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II
and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the Borrower

usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances.

BORROWER  Section 3.01    Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03,
if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation
to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect
thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07
and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after

delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the
basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such
certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity
Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim
under this Section 3.01 in respect of or attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the
Liquidity Provider to compensation under this Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any
such claim; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal
policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider
therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make
payments under this Section 3.01: (a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity
Providers jurisdiction of organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
promulgated or issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and
International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in
respect of an Increased Cost arises through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule,
regulation or interpretation giving rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not
also seeking payment for similar increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.

Section 3.02    Intentionally omitted. 
Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this
Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld , (ii) without duplication of any rights created by
Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered
Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a payment to the relevant authorities
furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider, within 10 Business Days of demand
therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with
applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise available to it as a result of, any Taxes
for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon), net of any
related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the Liquidity Provider the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund to such governmental or taxing
authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which would place the Liquidity
Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax benefit had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to make available its Tax returns (or
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  The Liquidity Provider will
(i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S.
taxpayer 
  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that
such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver
to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. 
If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the
Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to
the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity
Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to
deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the
Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes. 
Section 3.04    Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall make or cause to be made each
payment to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. The Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to
the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account set forth below or such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the Subordination Agent:

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have
been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR
Advance) or reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance. 
Section 3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause
to be paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including
the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class B Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied
Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class B Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder
(whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to
but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may be, as
in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise
applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate
of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon)
if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the circumstances giving rise to
such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each
change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to as the Applicable Liquidity Rate. 
Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower. Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the
successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of
Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated
therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder.  Section 3.09    Funding Loss
Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss,
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred
as a result of:  (1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on
the date for borrowing specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02. 
Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law,
rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to
maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the
Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of
any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances
under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will
lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such
designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the
Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for
conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

the Liquidity Provider of its obligations under any Operative Agreement. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all recording, stamp and other similar taxes and fees payable or determined to
be payable in the United States in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement, any other Operative Agreement and such other documents, and agrees to save the Liquidity Provider harmless from and against any and

Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Providers right to grant Participations pursuant to Section
7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended and (iii) such Participation shall not be made to any Person that is a commercial air

shall have no rights or benefits as against American or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such
obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein 
  27 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



(subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its participants. Accordingly, in determining
amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and capital adequacy requirements, increased costs,
reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are commercial banking institutions and of whose
participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and
references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a Participation, it shall, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in this Agreement. 
(c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant shall (i) represent
to the Liquidity Provider (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties, no taxes will be required to be withheld with respect to any income derived by such participant from the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
certifying, in each case, such participants entitlement to a complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements,
(iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document
expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the
participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to
the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity
Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is
confidential.

Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

in the City of New York and to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of

(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law. 
(b)    THE BORROWER AND THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED, including, without limitation, contract claims, tort

(ii)    As of the Second Amendment Effective Date, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment, the

a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (each, a Non-Converting Term Lender) shall be repaid in full in cash; 
  9 


(x)    to the extent any Lender has a 2017 Replacement
Term Loan Commitment that is less than the full outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of such Lender, such Lender shall be repaid in cash in an amount equal to the difference between the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of Existing Term Loans of such Lender and such Lenders 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (the Non-Converting Term Portion);

a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (each, a Converting Term Lender, and, together with the Non-Converting Term Lenders, the Existing Term Lenders) shall
automatically be converted into 2017 Replacement Term Loans (a Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loan) in a principal amount equal to such Converting Term Lenders Existing Term Loans outstanding on the

Lender) and (2) each Converting Term Lender with a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment in an amount in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of such Converting Term Lender (such difference, the

Replacement Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Replacement Term Lenders 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment as follows: (x) each Converting Term Lender shall fund its 2017 Replacement Term Loans to the
Borrower by converting its then outstanding principal amount of Existing Term Loans into 2017 Replacement Term Loans in an equal principal amount as provided in clause (ii)(y) above, (y) (1) each Converting Term Lender with a New Term
Commitment shall fund in cash an amount equal to its New Term Commitment to the Designated Replacement Term Lender and (2) each New Term Lender shall fund in cash an amount equal to its 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment to the
Designated Replacement Term Lender, and (z) the Designated Replacement Term Lender shall fund in cash to the Borrower an amount equal to the New Term Commitment of each Converting Term Lender and the 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment
of each New Term Lender.

(iv)    All outstanding Borrowings of Existing Term Loans shall continue in
effect for the equivalent principal amount of 2017 Replacement Term Loans after the Second Amendment Effective Date and each resulting borrowing of 2017 Replacement Term Loans shall be deemed to constitute a new deemed
borrowing under the Credit Agreement and be subject to the same Interest Period (and the same LIBO Rate) applicable to the Existing Term Loans to which it relates immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date, which Interest
Period shall continue in effect (until such Interest Periods expire, at which time subsequent Interest Periods shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Credit Agreement). New Term Loans shall be initially
incurred as Eurodollar Loans and shall be allocated ratably to the outstanding deemed borrowings of 2017 Replacement Term Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date. Each such Borrowing of New Term Loans shall be subject to
(x) an Interest Period which commences on the Second Amendment Effective Date and ends on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Existing Term Loans and (y) the same LIBO Rate applicable to the 2017 Replacement Term
Loans. The 2017 Replacement Term Loans of each Replacement Term Lender shall be allocated ratably to such Interest Periods (based upon the relative principal amounts of Borrowings of Existing Term Loans subject to such Interest Periods
immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date), with the effect being that Existing Term Loans which are converted into Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loans hereunder shall continue to be subject to the same Interest Periods and
any 2017 Replacement Term Loans that are funded in cash on the Second Amendment Effective Date shall be ratably allocated to the various Interest Periods as described above. 
(v)    On the Second Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower shall pay in cash (a) all interest accrued on the
Existing Term Loans through the Second Amendment Effective Date and (b) to each Non-Converting Term Lender and each Converting Term Lender with a Non-Converting
Term Portion, any breakage loss or expenses due under Section 2.15 of the Credit Agreement (it being understood that existing Interest Periods of the Existing Term Loans held by Replacement Term Lenders prior to the Second Amendment Effective
Date shall continue on and after the Second Amendment Effective Date and shall accrue interest in accordance with Section 2.07 of the Credit Agreement on and after the Second Amendment Effective Date). Each Converting Term Lender hereby waives
any entitlement to any breakage loss or expenses due under Section 2.15 of the Credit Agreement with respect to the repayment of that portion of its Existing Term Loans with the proceeds of Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loans. 
(vi)    On the Second Amendment Effective Date, all promissory notes, if any, evidencing the Existing Term Loans shall be
automatically cancelled, and any Replacement Term Lender may request that its 2017 Replacement Term Loan be evidenced by a promissory pursuant to Section 2.10(f) of the Credit Agreement.

 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary

 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.</p>

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02,</font> &#x201C;Leases (Topic
 842).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font>
 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font> is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.</p>

 <i><u>Statement of Cash Flows</u></i></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-18,</font> &#x201C;Statement of Cash
 Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-18</font> requires that the change in
 total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period
 on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
 restricted cash equivalents. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-18</font> also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented
 and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
 after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods within those
 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
 financial statements.</p>

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2017-07,</font> &#x201C;Compensation &#x2013;
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2017-07</font>
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported
 within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new
 standard will have no impact on <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">pre-tax</font> income or net income reported.
 See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost
 (income).</p>

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">10-K</font> for the year ended
 December&#xA0;31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and
 its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG&#x2019;s principal subsidiary is
 American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany
 transactions have been eliminated.</p>

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.</p>

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the

 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification

 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of

 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for

 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each

 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March&#xA0;31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2&#xA0;million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR
 stockholders.</p>

 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-pension,</font> postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April&#xA0;18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American&#x2019;s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-union</font> employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees&#x2019; benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. Our
 financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs
 without giving effect to any modification or termination of
 benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome
 of this proceeding.</p>

 <i>DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand</i>. In June 2015, we
 received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into
 whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air
 passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information
 from us, and other airlines have announced that they have received
 similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ
 investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the
 delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
 Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of
 litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as
 defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits
 alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
 capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal
 District Court for the District of Columbia. On October&#xA0;28,
 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to
 dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation
 and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and we
 intend to defend these matters vigorously.</p>

 <i>Private Party Antitrust Action</i>. On July&#xA0;2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section&#xA0;7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August&#xA0;6, 2013, the plaintiffs <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">re-filed</font> their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November&#xA0;27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs&#x2019; motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August&#xA0;19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October&#xA0;15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties&#x2019;
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February&#xA0;22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit
 and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.</p>

 <i>DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service</i>. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry
 regarding American&#x2019;s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the DOJ seeking
 certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has
 also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its
 investigation.</p>

 <i>General</i>. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other
 legal proceedings from time to time.&#xA0;Legal proceedings can be
 complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution,
 with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
 which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will
 vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above
 and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
 potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could
 be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors &#x2013;

 business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial

 conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in
 American&#x2019;s Annual Report on Form <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">10-K</font> for the year ended

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. American will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to
 adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective
 method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of
 the new revenue standard will impact its condensed consolidated
 financial statements. American currently expects that the new
 revenue standard will materially impact its liability for
 outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program
 members when flying on American. American currently uses the
 incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty
 program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the
 estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.
 The new revenue standard will require American to change its policy
 and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of
 each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned
 will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future
 mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage
 credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be
 materially greater under the relative selling price approach than
 the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental
 cost method. The new revenue standard will also require American to
 reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are
 currently included within other operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font> is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. American is currently evaluating how the
 adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed
 consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on American&#x2019;s implementation. Currently, American
 expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a
 material impact on its condensed consolidated balance sheet due to
 the recognition of <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.</p>

 restricted cash equivalents. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-18</font> also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented

 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of American&#x2019;s net periodic benefit cost (income), with the
 exception of service cost, currently reported within operating
 expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and
 reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.</p>

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. American will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to
 adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective
 method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of
 the new revenue standard will impact its condensed consolidated
 financial statements. American currently expects that the new
 revenue standard will materially impact its liability for
 outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program
 members when flying on American. American currently uses the
 incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty
 program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the
 estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.
 The new revenue standard will require American to change its policy
 and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of
 each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned
 will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future
 mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage
 credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be
 materially greater under the relative selling price approach than
 the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental
 cost method. The new revenue standard will also require American to
 reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are
 currently included within other operating revenue.</p>

 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods

 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. American is currently evaluating how the
 adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed
 consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on American&#x2019;s implementation. Currently, American
 expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a
 material impact on its condensed consolidated balance sheet due to

 <i>Chapter 11 Cases</i>. On November&#xA0;29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR&#x2019;s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October&#xA0;21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors&#x2019; fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December&#xA0;9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March&#xA0;31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2&#xA0;million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former
 AMR stockholders.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-pension,</font> postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April&#xA0;18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American&#x2019;s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-union</font> employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees&#x2019; benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees.
 American&#x2019;s financial statements presently reflect these
 retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or
 termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based
 upon the outcome of this proceeding.</p>

 <i>DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand</i>. In June 2015,
 American received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the
 United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an
 investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or
 coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and
 other information from American, and other airlines have announced
 that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating
 fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to
 announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along
 with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
 Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air
 Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative
 class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to
 air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in
 the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On
 October&#xA0;28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline
 defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ
 investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early
 stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously.</p>

 <i>Private Party Antitrust Action</i>. On July&#xA0;2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section&#xA0;7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August&#xA0;6, 2013, the plaintiffs <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">re-filed</font> their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November&#xA0;27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs&#x2019; motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August&#xA0;19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October&#xA0;15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties&#x2019;
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February&#xA0;22, 2017. American believes this lawsuit is without
 merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.</p>

 <i>DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal

 regarding American&#x2019;s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ
 seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ
 has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to
 its investigation.</p>

 <i>General</i>. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged in
 other legal proceedings from time to time.&#xA0;Legal proceedings
 can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach
 resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of
 variables, some of which are not within American&#x2019;s control.
 Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each
 of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings,
 their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts
 on American are uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item
 1A. Risk Factors &#x2013; &#x201C;<i>We may be a party to litigation

- DefinitionTotal of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest, minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

Basis of Presentation


1. Basis of Presentation

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 10-K for the year ended
 December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and
 its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG’s principal subsidiary is
 American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany
 transactions have been eliminated.

 On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.

 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.

Leases

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
 842).” ASU 2016-02
 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 right-of-use assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.

Statement of Cash Flows

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash
 Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in
 total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period
 on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
 restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented
 and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
 after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
 financial statements.

Retirement Benefits

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation –
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.” ASU 2017-07
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported
 within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new
 standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.
 See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost
 (income).

Equity [Abstract]
 



Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends


4. Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has
 approved six share repurchase programs aggregating
 $11.0 billion of authority. As of March 31, 2017,
 $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that
 expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our
 share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods,
 which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated
 transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase
 transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time
 subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal
 requirements and other relevant factors. Our share repurchase
 programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of
 shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017,
 we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
 $512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81.
 Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014,
 we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock
 for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost per share of
 $39.62.
Our Board of Directors declared the following cash
 dividends during the first quarter of 2017:

Any future dividends that may be declared and paid
 from time to time will be subject to market and economic
 conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
 factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed
 period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at
 our discretion.

2017 Aircraft Financing
 Activities

2017-1 EETCs
In January 2017, American created three
 pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million
 aggregate principal amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and
 Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the
 financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered to American
 through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the
 proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire
 Series AA, A and B equipment notes issued by American to the
 pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held
 in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as
 American issues additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to
 the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional
 equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are
 not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our
 condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by
 the depository are not American’s assets.

  
As of March 31, 2017, approximately
 $635 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to
 purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal
 payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in
 February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning
 in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018.
 The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.
Certain information regarding the 2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the
 remaining escrowed proceeds of the 2017-1 EETC, as of March 31,
 2017, is set forth in the table below.

2016-3 EETCs
During the first quarter of 2017, all remaining
 proceeds of the Series 2016-3 Class AA and Class A
 (the 2016-3 EETCs), in the
 amount of $109 million, were used to purchase equipment notes
 issued by American and, after giving effect to such purchase, all
 of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to
 purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with the
 financing of new aircraft on or following the delivery thereof.
 Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes are payable
 semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest
 payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning
 in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the
 aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2016-3 EETCs.

 financing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan
 agreements matures in 2027 through 2029.
2017 Other Financing
 Activities

2013 Credit Facilities
In March 2017, American and AAG amended the Amended
 and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated October 26,
 2015 (which amended and restated the Credit and Guaranty Agreement
 dated May 21, 2015), pursuant to which we refinanced the
 $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established
 thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together with the
 $1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such
 agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London
 Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate
 margin from 1.50% to 1.00%. The $1.4 billion revolving credit
 facility under the 2013 Credit Facilities (the 2013 Revolving
 Facility) remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2017,
 $1.8 billion of principal was outstanding under the 2013 Term
 Loan Facility and there were no borrowings or letters of credit
 outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.

 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion
 of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior
 taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable
 income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for
 use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in
 2022 if unused. We also had approximately $3.7 billion of NOL
 Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at
 December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through
 2036 if unused.

  

 At December 31, 2016, we had an alternative minimum tax credit
 carryforward of approximately $339 million available for
 federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite
 period.

 In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax provision
 of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the
 NOLs described above. Substantially all of our income before income
 taxes is attributable to the United States.

7. Fair Value Measurements
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring
 Basis
We utilize the market approach to measure fair
 value for our financial assets. The market approach uses prices and
 other relevant information generated by market transactions
 involving identical or comparable assets. Our short-term
 investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker
 quotes in a non-active
 market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation
 techniques or inputs occurred during the three months ended
 March 31, 2017.
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Legal Proceedings


11. Legal Proceedings

Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.

 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR
 stockholders.

 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. Our
 financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs
 without giving effect to any modification or termination of
 benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome
 of this proceeding.

DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we
 received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into
 whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air
 passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information
 from us, and other airlines have announced that they have received
 similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ
 investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the
 delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
 Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of
 litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as
 defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits
 alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
 capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal
 District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28,
 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to
 dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation
 and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and we
 intend to defend these matters vigorously.

  

Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties’
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February 22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit
 and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry
 regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the DOJ seeking
 certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has
 also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its
 investigation.

General. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other
 legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be
 complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution,
 with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
 which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will
 vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above
 and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
 potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could
 be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors –
 “We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of
 business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position
 and liquidity” for additional discussion.

 on American are uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item
 1A. Risk Factors – “We may be a party to litigation
 in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect
 our financial position and liquidity” for additional
 discussion.

Basis of Presentation (Policies)
3 Months Ended

Basis of Presentation


 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 10-K for the year ended
 December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and
 its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG’s principal subsidiary is
 American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany
 transactions have been eliminated.

 On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.




Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.

 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.

Leases

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
 842).” ASU 2016-02
 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 right-of-use assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.

Statement of Cash Flows

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash
 Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in
 total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period
 on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
 restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented
 and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
 after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
 financial statements.

Retirement Benefits

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation –
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.” ASU 2017-07
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported
 within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new
 standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.
 See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost
 (income).

This combined Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q is filed by American Airlines Group Inc. (formerly named AMR Corporation) (AAG) and its wholly-owned subsidiary American Airlines, Inc. (American). References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to we, us, our, the Company and similar terms refer to AAG and its consolidated subsidiaries. AMR or AMR Corporation refers to the Company
during the period of time prior to its emergence from Chapter 11 and its acquisition of US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group) on December 9, 2013. References to US Airways Group and US Airways, a subsidiary of US
Airways Group, represent the entities during the period of time prior to AAGs internal corporate restructuring on December 30, 2015. References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to
mainline refer to the operations of American only and exclude regional operations.  Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain of the statements contained in this report should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may be identified by words such
as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan, project, could, should, would,
continue, seek, target, guidance, outlook, if current trends continue, optimistic, forecast and other similar words. Such statements include, but are not
limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, estimates and strategies for the future, and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on our current objectives, beliefs
and expectations, and they are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and financial position and timing of certain events to differ materially from the information in the forward-looking statements. These risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described below under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC. 
All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in Part II, Item
1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. There may be other factors of which we are not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or supplement any forward-looking statement to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such statements other than as required by law.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or as of the dates indicated in the statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN
AIRLINES GROUP INC.  (Unaudited) 
1. Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAGs principal subsidiary is American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways
Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On
December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring
items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue
standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the new
revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at the
date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. 
We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost
method to account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require us to change our policy and
apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned
mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue standard
will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. 
Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying
principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial
application with an option to use certain practical expedients.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.
 (Unaudited)   

We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are
on-going and could have a material impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to
the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. 
Statement of Cash Flows 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not expected to have
a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new
standard will require all components of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within nonoperating
income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost (income).

 4. Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends 
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved six share repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority.
As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other
relevant factors. Our share repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
$512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014, we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost
per share of $39.62.  Our Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during the first quarter of 2017:

2017-1 EETCs 
In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal
amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered
to American through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA, A and B
equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as American issues
additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our condensed
consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not Americans assets.

 (Unaudited)   
As of March 31, 2017, approximately $635 million of the escrowed
proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each
year, with interest payments beginning in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018. The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft. 
Certain information regarding the 2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the remaining
escrowed proceeds of the 2017-1 EETC, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

During the first quarter of 2017, all remaining proceeds of the Series 2016-3
Class AA and Class A (the 2016-3 EETCs), in the amount of $109 million, were used to purchase equipment notes issued by American and, after giving effect to such purchase, all of the proceeds
received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with the financing of new aircraft on or following the delivery thereof. Interest and
principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the
aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2016-3 EETCs.  Certain information
regarding the 2016-3 EETC equipment notes, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

 Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2017 
In the first quarter of 2017, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $155 million in connection with the
financing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2027 through 2029.  2017
Other Financing Activities  2013 Credit Facilities 
In March 2017, American and AAG amended the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated October 26, 2015
(which amended and restated the Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated May 21, 2015), pursuant to which we refinanced the $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together with the
$1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate margin from 1.50% to 1.00%. The $1.4 billion
revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Facilities (the 2013 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2017, $1.8 billion of principal was outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings or
letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  6. Income Taxes 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior
taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. We also had approximately
$3.7 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2036 if unused.

 (Unaudited)   
At December 31, 2016, we had an alternative minimum tax credit
carryforward of approximately $339 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period. 
In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the NOLs described above. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. 
7. Fair Value Measurements 
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
We utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Our short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for
valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

 Unrealized gains or losses on short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at each measurement date.

 All short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Our short-term investments mature in one year or less except for $1.1 billion of bank notes/certificates of
deposit/time deposits and $421 million of corporate obligations.  Fair Value of Debt
 The fair value of our long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses,
based on our current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If our long-term debt was measured at fair value, it would have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
The carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows (in

 11. Legal Proceedings 
Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to
the Plan and completed the Merger.  Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims
Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG
common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the
Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the
extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this
proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID)
from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have
announced that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have
been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are
in their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously.

 (Unaudited)   
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit
captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of
the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their
complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely
unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class
action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on
October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and
intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.  DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the
DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the
False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. 
General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in
other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control.
Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part
II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for additional discussion. 
12. Subsequent Event  Dividend
Declaration  In April 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a $0.10 per share dividend for
stockholders of record on May 16, 2017, and payable on May 30, 2017. Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN
AIRLINES, INC.  (Unaudited)  1.
Basis of Presentation  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of American Airlines,
Inc. (American) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in Americans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. American is the
principal wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways
Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. On
December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure, US Airways, Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group, merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. 
Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring
items, have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets, as well as pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation. The new revenue
standard applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. American will adopt the
new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard at
the date of initial application and not adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective method. 
American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the new revenue standard will impact its condensed
consolidated financial statements. American currently expects that the new revenue standard will materially impact its liability for outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when flying on American. American currently
uses the incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard will require
American to change its policy and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be materially greater under the relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental cost method.
The new revenue standard will also require American to reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other operating revenue. 
Leases 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying
principles of the new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial
application with an option to use certain practical expedients.

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC. 
(Unaudited)   

American is currently evaluating how the adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are
on-going and could have a material impact on Americans implementation. Currently, American expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated
balance sheet due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for as operating leases. 
Statement of Cash Flows 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and restricted cash
equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not expected to have
a material impact on Americans condensed consolidated financial statements.  Retirement Benefits 
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is presented. This standard is to be applied
retrospectively to each period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. The new
standard will require all components of Americans net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported within
nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported. See Note 6 for Americans current components of net periodic benefit cost
(income).  2. Special Items, Net

2017-1 EETCs 
In January 2017, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal
amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered
to American through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire Series AA, A and B
equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as American issues
additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its condensed
consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depository are not Americans assets.  As of
March 31, 2017, approximately $635 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal payments on the
equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018. The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.  Certain information regarding the
2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the remaining escrowed proceeds of the 2017-1 EETC, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

During the first quarter of 2017, all remaining proceeds of the Series 2016-3
Class AA and Class A (the 2016-3 EETCs), in the amount of $109 million, were used to purchase equipment notes issued by American and, after giving effect to such purchase, all of the proceeds
received from the sale of the 2016-3 EETCs have been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with the financing of new aircraft on or following the delivery thereof. Interest and
principal payments on the equipment notes are payable semi-annually in April and October of each year, with interest payments beginning in April 2017 and principal payments beginning in October 2017. These equipment notes are secured by liens on the
aircraft financed with the proceeds of the 2016-3 EETCs.  Certain information
regarding the 2016-3 EETC equipment notes, as of March 31, 2017, is set forth in the table below.

 Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2017 
In the first quarter of 2017, American entered into loan agreements to borrow $155 million in connection with the
financing of certain aircraft. Debt incurred under these loan agreements matures in 2027 through 2029.  2017
Other Financing Activities  2013 Credit Facilities 
In March 2017, American and AAG amended the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated October 26, 2015
(which amended and restated the Credit and Guaranty Agreement dated May 21, 2015), pursuant to which American refinanced the $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together
with the $1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate margin from 1.50% to 1.00%. The
$1.4 billion revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Facilities (the 2013 Revolving Facility) remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2017, $1.8 billion of principal was outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan Facility and there were
no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility.  4. Income Taxes 
At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from
prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. American is a member of AAGs consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns.
The amount of federal NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $10.5 billion, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2022 if unused. American also
had approximately $3.4 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through 2034 if unused. 
At December 31, 2016, American had an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $452 million
available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.  In the first quarter of 2017,
American recorded an income tax provision of $148 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the NOLs described above. Substantially all of Americans income before income
taxes is attributable to the United States.

5. Fair Value Measurements 
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
American utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Americans short-term investments classified as Level 2 primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active
market for valuation of these securities. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):

 All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Americans short-term investments mature in one year or less except for $1.1 billion of bank notes/certificates of
deposit/time deposits and $421 million of corporate obligations.  Fair Value of Debt
 The fair value of Americans long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow
analyses, based on Americans current estimated incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. If Americans long-term debt was measured at fair value, it would have been classified as Level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy.  The carrying value and estimated fair value of Americans long-term debt, including current
maturities, were as follows (in millions):

10. Legal Proceedings 
Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic
subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to
the Plan and completed the Merger.  Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims
Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG
common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the
Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To
the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Americans financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of
this proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, American received a Civil Investigative
Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from American, and
other airlines have announced that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ
investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously. 
Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group,
Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of
Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as
defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a
fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter,
plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and
expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.

DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal Service. In
April 2015, the DOJ informed American of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ
seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False
Claims Act or other statutes. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation. 
General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged
in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within Americans
control. Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on American are uncertain but could be
material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for additional discussion.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Part I, Item 2 of this report should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 of AAGs
and Americans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the 2016 Form 10-K). The information contained herein is not a comprehensive
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of AAG and American, but rather updates disclosures made in the 2016 Form 10-K. 
Background  Together with
our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries, principally from our
hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In the first quarter of 2017, approximately 46 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights. 
We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our
operation, to building the best employee relations in the industry and to providing returns for our stockholders. In January 2017, we were named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World, which cited the integration work related to
the Merger, our operational and customer service improvements and the investments we are making in our product.  Financial Overview 
The U.S. Airline Industry 
In the first quarter of 2017, U.S. airlines were impacted by substantially higher fuel prices. Jet fuel prices closely follow
the price of Brent crude oil. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 59% higher in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during the first quarter of
2017 was $54 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $34 per barrel during the first quarter of 2016. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during the quarter between a high of $56 per barrel to a low of $50 per
barrel, and closed the quarter on March 31, 2017 at $52 per barrel. With respect to U.S. airline revenues, industry results were improving but remained mixed due in part to the lingering effects of competitive capacity growth in certain
domestic and international markets.  See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions
could adversely affect our business and Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the
supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.

 See below Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial
Measures and Note 2 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for details on the components of special items. 
Pre-Tax Income and Net Income 
We realized net income of $234 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to net income of $700 million in the
first quarter of 2016. Pre-tax income was $365 million and $1.1 billion in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax
net special items, we recognized pre-tax income of $491 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter declines in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits due to
wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
Revenue  In the first
quarter of 2017, we reported total operating revenues of $9.6 billion, an increase of $189 million, or 2.0%, as compared to the 2016 period. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $8.2 billion, an increase of $68 million,
or 0.8%, as compared to the 2016 period. The increase in mainline and regional passenger revenues was driven by a 2.4% period-over-period increase in consolidated passenger yields. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.1% and international yields
rose 0.6%, driven by improvement in Latin America. The first quarter of 2017 marks a second consecutive quarter of period-over-period increasing yields, which has not occurred since the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Additionally, other revenues increased $111 million primarily due to revenues associated with our loyalty program,
principally new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. Our mainline and regional total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 14.96 cents in the first
quarter of 2017, a 3.1% increase as compared to 14.50 cents in the first quarter of 2016.  Fuel 
Our mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017, which was $472 million, or
37.8%, higher as compared to the 2016 period. This increase was driven by a 40.4% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.70 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.21 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 1.8% decrease in gallons of
fuel consumed.  As of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel
consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our
fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. 
  31 


Table of Contents
Other Costs 
We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic
prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. 
Our 2017 first quarter mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 13.17 cents, an increase of 13.7%, from 11.58 cents in
2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts described above. 
Our 2017 first quarter mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel was 10.48 cents, an increase of 8.9% as compared to the
2016 period, which was also driven by higher salaries, wages and benefits.  For a reconciliation of mainline CASM
excluding special items and fuel, see below Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
Liquidity and Stockholder Returns 
As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $6.7 billion
in unrestricted cash and investments and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash of $543 million. 
During the first quarter of 2017, we returned $563 million to our stockholders, including quarterly dividend payments of
$51 million and the repurchase of $512 million of common stock, or 11.7 million shares. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned more than $10.2 billion to
stockholders, including $697 million in quarterly dividend payments and $9.5 billion in share repurchases, or 240.0 million shares. In April 2017, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share dividend for stockholders of record
on May 16, 2017, and payable on May 30, 2017.  We continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates
to finance our fleet renewal program. During the first quarter 2017, to finance new aircraft deliveries, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $744 million in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) equipment notes at an average fixed
interest rate of 3.86%, as well as $155 million in other equipment notes, which primarily bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin, averaging 2.63% at March 31, 2017. Additionally, we refinanced a $1.8 billion term
loan facility. See Note 5 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for additional information on our debt obligations. 
As a result of the foregoing factors, we currently have a higher debt level and fewer unencumbered assets than our peers.
Accordingly, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage as well as to protect against an adverse economic shock. Our current plan is to maintain minimum total available liquidity of
$7.0 billion. We were well above that minimum level at March 31, 2017.  Reconciliation of GAAP to
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  We sometimes use financial measures that are
derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or
superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial
measures on a GAAP basis.

Table of Contents

The table below presents the reconciliation of pre-tax income (GAAP measure) to pre-tax income excluding special items (non-GAAP measure). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As special
items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude special items allows management an additional tool to better understand our core
operating performance.

 Additionally, the table below presents the reconciliation of mainline operating costs (GAAP
measure) to mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance
and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze our
non-fuel costs and core operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 
We realized pre-tax income of $365 million and $1.1 billion in the first
quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $491 million and $1.2 billion in the first
quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our first quarter 2017 pre-tax results
on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts,
including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.  Operating

 Total passenger revenues increased $68 million, or 0.8%, in the first quarter of 2017
from the 2016 period primarily driven by a 2.4% period-over-period increase in consolidated passenger yields. Domestic consolidated yields increased 3.1% and international yields rose 0.6%, driven by improvement in Latin America. 
Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport
clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $111 million, or 9.3%, in the first quarter of 2017 from the 2016 period primarily driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, other revenue
associated with our loyalty program was $604 million and $491 million, respectively, of which $530 million and $427 million, respectively, related to the marketing component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments.
This period-over-period increase was primarily due to revenues associated with our new co-branded credit card agreements that became effective in the third quarter of 2016. 
Total operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 increased $189 million, or 2.0%, from the 2016 period driven
principally by a 9.3% increase in other revenue as described above. Our mainline and regional TRASM was 14.96 cents in the first quarter of 2017, a 3.1% increase as compared to 14.50 cents in the 2016 period.

 Mainline operating expenses increased $782 million, or 11.7%, in the first quarter of
2017 from the 2016 period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in mainline CASM. 
Mainline CASM 
We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not
presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are
providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. 
The table below presents the reconciliation of mainline operating expenses (GAAP measure) to mainline operating costs
excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of
period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze
our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.  The major components of our
total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):

Table of Contents

Significant changes in the components of mainline CASM are as follows: 
 


 

 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM increased 38.6% primarily due to a 40.1% increase in the average price
per gallon of fuel to $1.69 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.20 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 2.8% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed.   


 

 
 Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 8.4% primarily due to increased costs associated with wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
 


 

 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM increased 19.5% as compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to an
increase in the volume of engine overhauls and a shift in timing of maintenance expenses incurred. This shift was driven by the transition to a new flight hour based maintenance contract from a time and materials based contract for certain flight
equipment.   


 

 
 Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 16.1% primarily due to aircraft purchased in connection with
our fleet renewal program.   


 

 
 Other operating expenses per ASM increased 9.0% primarily due to expenses associated with improving our
product offerings, customer experience and operational reliability.  Operating Special Items, Net

 Regional operating expenses increased $141 million, or 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2017
from the 2016 period. The period-over-period increase was primarily due to a $99 million, or 45.2%, increase in fuel costs and a $42 million, or 3.4%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel
increased 41.5% to $1.75 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.24 in the 2016 period, on a 2.6% increase in consumption. The increase in other regional operating expenses was primarily driven by a 3.7% increase in capacity, principally from our
wholly-owned regional carriers. See Note 10 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for further information on regional expenses.

 Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided
relatively nominal returns. Interest income increased $8 million, or 63.6%, principally due to an increase in interest rates, which drove more than a 50 basis point increase in average yields in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016
period.  Interest expense, net increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period
primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with our fleet renewal program.  Income Taxes
 In the first quarter 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our net operating losses (NOLs). Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately
$10.5 billion of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. 
See Note 6 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A for additional information on income
taxes.  Americans Results of Operations 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 
American realized pre-tax income of $411 million and $1.1 billion in the
first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $537 million and $1.2 billion in the
first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Americans first quarter 2017
pre-tax results on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items were principally driven by higher fuel costs as well as higher salaries, wages and benefits
due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.

Other revenue primarily includes revenue associated with Americans loyalty
program, baggage fees, ticketing change fees, airport clubs and inflight services. Other revenue increased $116 million, or 9.8%, in the first quarter of 2017 from the 2016 period primarily driven by an increase in loyalty program revenue. In
the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, other revenue associated with Americans loyalty program was $604 million and $491 million, respectively, of which $530 million and $427 million, respectively, related to the marketing
component of mileage sales and other marketing related payments. This period-over-period increase was primarily due to revenues associated with Americans new co-branded credit card agreements that became
effective in the third quarter of 2016.  Total operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 increased
$194 million, or 2.1%, from the 2016 period driven principally by a 9.8% increase in other revenue as described above.

 Mainline operating expenses increased $780 million, or 11.7%, in the first quarter of
2017 from the 2016 period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits. Detailed explanations related to the changes in Americans mainline operating expenses are as
follows:   


 

 
 Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 36.2% primarily due to a 40.1% increase in the average price per
gallon of fuel to $1.69 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.20 in the 2016 period, offset in part by a 2.8% decrease in gallons of fuel consumed.   


 

 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 6.5% primarily due to increased costs associated with wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
 


 

 
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 17.5% as compared to the 2016 period, primarily due to an
increase in the volume of engine overhauls and a shift in timing of maintenance expenses incurred. This shift was driven by the transition to a new flight hour based maintenance contract from a time and materials based contract for certain flight
equipment.   


 

 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 14.1% primarily due to aircraft purchased in connection with
Americans fleet renewal program.   


 

 
 Other operating expenses increased 7.0% primarily due to expenses associated with improving our product
offerings, customer experience and operational reliability.

from the 2016 period. The period-over-period increase was primarily due to a $99 million, or 45.2%, increase in fuel costs and a $34 million, or 2.8%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel
increased 41.5% to $1.75 in the first quarter of 2017 from $1.24 in the 2016 period, on a 2.6% increase in consumption. The increase in other regional operating expenses was primarily driven by increased capacity. See Note 8 to Americans

 Americans short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments
that provided nominal returns. Interest income increased $28 million principally due to an increase in interest rates, which drove more than a 50 basis point increase in average yields in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016
period.  Interest expense, net increased $23 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period
primarily due to higher outstanding debt as a result of aircraft financings associated with Americans fleet renewal program.

Income Taxes 
In the first quarter 2017, American recorded an income tax provision of $148 million, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of its NOLs. Substantially all of Americans income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2016, American had approximately $11.3 billion
of gross NOLs to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2017. 
See Note 4 to Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1B for additional information on
income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Liquidity  As of
March 31, 2017, AAG had approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity and $543 million in restricted cash and short-term investments. Additional detail of our available liquidity is provided in the table below (in millions):

 Share Repurchase Programs 
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved six share repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority.
As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open
market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other
relevant factors. Our share repurchase programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
$512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014, we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost
per share of $39.62.  Cash Dividends Paid

suspended at any time at our discretion.  Sources and Uses of Cash 
AAG 
Operating Activities 
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion for the first three months of 2017
and 2016, respectively, a period-over-period decrease of $370 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower profitability in the first quarter of 2017 driven by higher fuel costs as well as salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate
increases in certain labor contracts, including our maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016.

Investing Activities 
Our net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the first three months of 2017 and
2016, respectively.  Our principal investing activities in the 2017 period included expenditures of $1.7 billion for
property and equipment, primarily 22 aircraft, including eight Airbus A321 aircraft, five Embraer 175 aircraft, five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and four Boeing 787 aircraft. We also had $262 million in net
purchases of short-term investments.  Our principal investing activities in the 2016 period included expenditures of
$1.6 billion for property and equipment, primarily 28 aircraft, including seven Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Airbus A321 aircraft, six Embraer 175 aircraft, five Boeing 737-800 aircraft, two Boeing 787
aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft. We also had $565 million in net purchases of short-term investments.  Financing Activities
 Our net cash used in financing activities was $349 million and $401 million for the first three months of
2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our principal financing activities in the 2017 period included proceeds of $899 million
from the issuance of debt, primarily including the issuance of $744 million of EETCs. These cash inflows were offset in part by $686 million in debt repayments, $484 million in share repurchases and $51 million in dividend
payments.  Our principal financing activities in the 2016 period included proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance
of debt, primarily including the issuance of $1.1 billion of EETCs. These cash inflows were offset in part by $1.5 billion in share repurchases, $310 million in debt repayments and $61 million in dividend payments. 
American 
Operating Activities 
Americans net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion for the first three
months of 2017 and 2016, respectively, a period-over-period increase of $662 million. We have the ability to move funds freely between our subsidiaries to support our cash requirements. The increase in operating cash flows during the first
quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 period was primarily due to a decrease in intercompany cash transfers from American to AAG. This increase in operating cash flows was offset in part by lower profitability driven by higher fuel costs as well
as salaries, wages and benefits due to wage rate increases in certain labor contracts, including Americans maintenance and fleet service work groups, which became effective subsequent to the first quarter of 2016. 
Investing Activities 
Americans net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for the first three months of

Commitments  Significant
Indebtedness  As of March 31, 2017, AAG and American had $24.8 billion and $23.0 billion,
respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities of $1.7 billion each). During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there have been no material changes in our significant indebtedness as discussed in our
2016 Form 10-K, except as discussed in Note 5 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A and Note 3 to Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,
Item 1B.  Collateral Related Covenants 
Certain of our debt financing agreements contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to annually appraise the related
collateral. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash collateral), or pay down such
financing, in whole or in part. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the collateral coverage tests for the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2014 Credit Facilities, the April 2016 Credit Facilities and the December 2016 Credit Facilities
as of the most recent measurement dates.  Credit Ratings 
The following table details AAG and Americans credit ratings as of March 31, 2017:

(1)
 The credit agency does not rate this category for
American.  A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would
increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which
could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our
indebtedness.

 On April 24, 2017, American and Airbus entered into
an agreement to revise the delivery schedule of the A350s, and such revised delivery schedule is reflected in the table above. Previously, the delivery schedule for the A350s was two in 2018, five in 2019, five in 2020, five in 2021 and five in
2022. The future payments in the Contractual Obligations table below also reflect this agreement. See Item 5. Other Information. 


(2)
 Reflects an agreement with Boeing reached in April 2017
to defer the delivery of two B787 family aircraft from 2018 to 2019. The future payments in the Contractual Obligations table below also reflect this agreement. 


(3)
 These aircraft may be operated by wholly-owned regional
subsidiaries or leased to third-party regional carriers which would operate the aircraft under capacity purchase arrangements. 


(4)
 Reflects Americans exercise of options to purchase
four additional aircraft scheduled to be delivered in November and December of 2017. The future payments associated with these aircraft are reflected in the Contractual Obligations table below. 
We also have agreements for 42 spare engines to be delivered in 2017 and beyond. 
As of March 31, 2017, we did not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled
to be delivered through 2017: 14 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, eight Airbus A320 family aircraft, eight Boeing 787 family aircraft and four Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft. In addition, we do not have financing
commitments in place for substantially all aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate
successfully for additional discussion.  Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements  An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction,
agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments
classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and
development arrangements with us.  There have been no material changes in our
off-balance sheet arrangements as discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K. 
Labor Contracts 
On April 26, 2017, we offered a mid-contract hourly base pay rate adjustment for our flight attendants and pilots of an average
of approximately 5% and 8%, respectively. We estimate that the impact on our salary and benefits expense would be approximately $230 million for 2017 and $350 million for 2018 and 2019. The amendable dates for these workgroups are December 2019
(flight attendants) and January 2020 (pilots).

(1) 
 Amounts represent contractual amounts due. Excludes $231 million and $12 million of unamortized debt
discount, premium and issuance costs as of March 31, 2017 for American and AAG Parent, respectively. For additional information, see Note 5 and Note 3 to AAGs and Americans Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,
Items 1A and 1B. 


(2) 
 For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at
March 31, 2017. 


(3) 
 Includes $11.2 billion of future principal payments and $2.8 billion of future interest payments,
respectively, as of March 31, 2017, related to EETC notes associated with mortgage financings for the purchase of certain aircraft. 


(4) 
 See Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about these obligations. 


(5) 
 Includes $1.3 billion of future minimum lease payments related to EETC leverage leased financings of
certain aircraft as of March 31, 2017. 


(6) 
 Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These
commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. 


(7) 
 Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and retiree medical and other
postretirement benefit payments and is based on estimated payments through 2026. The total pension contribution of $279 million for the remainder of 2017 assumes a supplemental contribution of $254 million in addition to the
$25 million minimum required contribution. 


(8) 
 Includes a $200 million equity investment in China Southern Airlines, the closing of which is dependent
upon obtaining regulatory and other approvals.  Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions 
In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft, the servicing and amortization
of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, as well as future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into
leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to
cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease
outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a
general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing
arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.

Table of Contents
In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our
debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other
considerations, we may continue to take such actions.  Our Board of Directors, has from time to time authorized programs
to repurchase shares of our common stock, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.  Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  In the first quarter of 2017, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from
those disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our 2016 Form 10-K. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See Note 1 to AAGs Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1A and Note 1 to Americans Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1B for further information on recent accounting pronouncements.   


ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  AAG and
Americans Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions  Our primary market risk exposures include the
price of aircraft fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk. Our exposure to these market risks has not changed materially from our exposure discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K except as updated
below.  Aircraft Fuel 
As of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and
assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we
review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Our 2017 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption is presently approximately 4.3 billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one cent per gallon
increase in aviation fuel price would result in a $43 million increase in annual expense.  Foreign Currency 
We are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated
operating revenues and expenses. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. 
Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect
the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be,
adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control for additional discussion of this and other currency risks. 
  46 


Table of Contents
Interest 
Our earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest
expense from variable-rate debt instruments and our interest income from short-term investments. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our March 31, 2017 variable-rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual
interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $96 million and annual interest income on short-term investments would increase by approximately $69 million. 
 


ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. An evaluation of the effectiveness of AAGs and Americans disclosure
controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of AAGs and Americans management, including AAGs and Americans Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO). Based on that evaluation, AAGs and Americans management, including AAGs and Americans CEO and CFO, concluded that AAGs and Americans disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
March 31, 2017.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
On December 9, 2013, AAG acquired US Airways Group and its subsidiaries. We are still in the process of integrating
certain processes, technology and operations for the post-Merger combined company, and we will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to our internal control over financial reporting. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there
has been no change in AAGs or Americans internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AAGs and Americans internal control over financial reporting. 
Limitation on the Effectiveness of Controls 
We believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the
objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO of AAG and American believe that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2017.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 


ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011,
AMR, American, and certain of AMRs other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date,
December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger. 
Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common
stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed
Claims Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about the Effective Date. However, we are not
required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares
remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders. 
There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court
granted Americans motion for summary judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary judgment motion was denied
with respect to all other retirees. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits concerning whether those retirees benefits are vested, and American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from obligations to provide
benefits to any of those retirees. Our financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome of this
proceeding.  DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID)
from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information from us, and other airlines have
announced that they have received similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have
been consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation and these lawsuits are
in their relatively early stages and we intend to defend these matters vigorously.  Private Party Antitrust Action.
On July 2, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group and US
Airways, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well
as claims similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the Fjord matter with the putative class
action lawsuits, which was denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on February 22, 2017. We believe
this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.  DOJ Investigation Related to
the United States Postal Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry regarding Americans 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In October 2015, we
received a CID from the DOJ seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating
potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its investigation.

General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we
and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are
uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity for
additional discussion.   


ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS  Below are certain risk factors that may affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment,
and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination
thereof, may impact our business.  Risks Relating to AAG and Industry-Related Risks 
Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. 
Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline
industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger
demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our revenues. See also The airline industry is intensely
competitive and dynamic below.  Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued
periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity. 
Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel,
which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Jet fuel market prices have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile. 
Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of
fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares,
impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Similarly, we cannot predict the effect or the actions of our competitors if the current low fuel prices remain in place for a significant period of
time or fuel prices decrease in the future.  Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel,
we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in fuel-related governmental
policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and
other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. 
Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs.
Prior to the closing of the Merger, we sought to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to
time based on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2017, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we
will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.  If in the future we enter into derivative contracts to
hedge our fuel consumption, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs or that our counterparties will be able to perform under our
derivative contracts. To the extent we use derivative contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly, such derivative contracts may limit our ability to benefit from lower fuel costs
in the future. Also, a rapid decline in the projected price of fuel at a time when we have fuel hedging contracts in place could materially adversely impact our short-term liquidity, because hedge counterparties could require that we post collateral
in the form of cash or letters of credit. See also the discussion in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Aircraft Fuel.

Table of Contents
The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic. 
Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures
formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with
at least one low-cost air carrier. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities and promotions, which can have a substantial
adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute
pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability. 
Low-cost carriers, including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from
larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently and are price sensitive and tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. A number of
low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost
carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and could continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. For example, as a result of divestitures completed in
connection with gaining regulatory approval for the Merger, low-fare, low-cost carriers have gained additional access in a number of markets, including Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport (DCA), a slot-controlled airport. In addition, we and several other large network carriers have announced basic economy fares designed to compete against low-cost
carriers and we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful or the competitive reaction of the low-cost carriers. The actions of the low-cost carriers,
including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.  Our
presence in international markets is not as extensive as that of some of our competitors. In providing international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations with
U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines, including carriers based in the Middle East, the three largest of which we believe benefit from significant government subsidies. Our international
service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand, such as we have recently experienced in Brazil and Venezuela, when any foreign countries we serve suffer adverse local economic conditions. In addition, open skies
agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets. See also Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our
costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. 
Certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from
antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively
compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to
maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.  We are party to
antitrust-immunized cooperation agreements with British Airways, Iberia, Finnair, Royal Jordanian, Japan Airlines, LAN Airlines and LAN Peru. As part of the antitrust-immunized relationships, we have also established joint business agreements (JBAs)
with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, and separately with Japan Airlines. We signed a revised JBA with Qantas Airways and applied for antitrust immunity with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the revised relationship, but we
withdrew that application in November 2016 after it was tentatively denied by the DOT. However, we expect that our existing, more limited cooperation with Qantas will continue, and we intend to file a new application for antitrust immunity with the
DOT this year. In addition, we have signed JBAs with certain air carriers of the LATAM Airlines Group and have applied for approval in the relevant jurisdictions affected by such agreements, which applications are still pending before the relevant
regulators. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance of the other airlines party to those agreements. No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from
such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented.

Table of Contents
Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust
immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive
position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth
will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could result in lower overall market share and revenues for us. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in
Europe and elsewhere.  Ongoing data security requirements and obligations could increase our costs, and any significant data security
incident could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of customer, employee, business partner and other sensitive
information, and confidence in the networks and systems that allow us to operate. We cannot be certain that we will not be the target of attacks on our networks and intrusions into our data, particularly given recent advances in technical
capabilities, and increased financial and political motivations to carry out cyber-attacks on physical systems, gain unauthorized access to information, and make information unavailable for use through, for example, ransomware or denial-of-service attacks, and otherwise exploit new and existing vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. The risk of a data security incident or disruption, particularly
through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
Furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on attacks on critical infrastructures, including those in the transportation sector, and on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in
the European Union (EU)), including requirements for varying levels of data subject notification in the event of a data security incident. 
In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we
must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these
standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs.  A
significant data security incident or our failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data security regulations or other data security standards may impact our brand and expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, resulting in
fines, sanctions or other penalties. Such actions could further harm our reputation, adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees, and stockholders, result in material financial impact, and disrupt business operations. Failure to
appropriately address these issues could also give rise to similar legal risks and damages.  Our high level of debt and other
obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry
conditions.  We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations,
obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a
substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they:

 may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness; 
 


 

 
 may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
investments, integration costs, and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;   


 

 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness
and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;   


 

 
 make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events,
particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage; 
  51 


Table of Contents


 

 
 contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and
cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities;   


 

 
 contain restrictive covenants that could: 
 


 

 
 limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock,
make investments and pay dividends;   


 

 
 significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own
operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines; 
 


 

 
 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing
business and economic conditions; and   


 

 
 result in an event of default under our indebtedness. 
Further, a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London
interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and the supply of and demand for credit in
the London interbank market. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the
extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be
adversely affected. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest. 
These obligations also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our
business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.  We
will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.  Our business plan contemplates
significant investments in modernizing our fleet. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of March 31, 2017, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase
commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2017-2021 would be approximately $13.1 billion. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft. If we are unable to
arrange financing for such aircraft at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft with
the aircraft manufacturers. Depending on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets view of our prospects and the airline industry in general,
and the general availability of debt and equity capital at the time we seek capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no
assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.  We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may
adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.  Our pension funding obligations
are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our
pension plans is subject to favorable temporary funding rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Our minimum pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially beginning in 2019, when we will be required to make
contributions relating to the 2018 fiscal year. In addition, we may have significant obligations for other postretirement benefits, the ultimate amount of which depends on, among other things, the outcome of an adversary proceeding related to
retiree medical and other postretirement benefits and life insurance obligations filed in the Chapter 11 Cases.

If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other
commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.  We have agreements with companies that process customer
credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, the failure of American to maintain certain levels of
liquidity) to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently
required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in
our financial condition. An increase in the current holdbacks, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, could materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other
entities to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. 
Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations. 
Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA,
collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain amendable dates rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a
multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB). For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item 1. Business 
Employees and Labor Relations in our 2016 Form 10-K.  In the
case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation
and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration
to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day cooling off period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential
Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day cooling off
period. At the end of a cooling off period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise self-help, such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.  None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully
engage in concerted refusals to work, such as strikes, slow-downs, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that disgruntled employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more
concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. See also Part I, Item 1. Business  Employees and Labor Relations in our 2016 Form 10-K.  The inability to maintain labor costs at competitive levels would harm our
financial performance.  Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network
carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because some of our agreements are amendable now and others may become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may
agree to higher-cost provisions in our current or future labor negotiations, such as the employee profit sharing program we instituted effective January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 85% of our employees were represented
for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. Unions may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to
engage in bargaining processes where we believe we have no such obligation. If successful, there is a risk these judicial or arbitral avenues could create material additional costs that we did not anticipate. 
Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
We operate principally through hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia,
Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs resulting from air traffic control (ATC) delays, weather
conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, relations with third-party service providers, failure of computer systems, disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations, labor relations, power
supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities, or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and
infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.
 In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or
existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas, operations control facilities and office space. As airports around the world become more
congested, we are not always able to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including due to inadequate facilities at desirable
airports. Further, our operating costs at airports at which we operate, including our hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that we may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. In some circumstances,
such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval.  In addition, operations at three
major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through the use of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct
operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) currently regulates the allocation of slots or slot exemptions at DCA and two New York City airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport (LGA). In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and
DCA are also limited based on the stage length of the flight. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority. Similarly, our operations at international airports in Beijing, Frankfurt,
London Heathrow, Paris, Tokyo and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the International Airline Trade Association (IATA) Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have
sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. However, there is no assurance that we will be
able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental
policies. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago OHare International Airport (ORD) and
Los Angeles International Airport, where the airport gate and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.
 Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, operations
control facilities, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations
could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.  A
significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, primarily under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risks
of disruptions to their operations, which may result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain necessary personnel, including in
particular pilots, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. Many of these third-party regional
operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Volatility in fuel prices, disruptions to capital markets and adverse economic
conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have led to several bankruptcies among these operators. For example, one of our significant third-party operators of
regional capacity, Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (Republic), commenced a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on February 25, 2016. As part of Republics restructuring process and with bankruptcy court approval, we entered into an amendment to our
contractual relationship with Republic that, among other things, provided for the reduction in the number of aircraft operated by Republic on our behalf to 76 E175 aircraft (a reduction of 20 E170 and nine E175 aircraft). In addition, we have
reached a settlement with Republic that has resulted in the allowance of an unsecured claim on behalf of American, to compensate us in part for losses and damages that we incurred under the existing contract with Republic. This claim is expected to
be settled in the form of common stock representing an approximate 25% ownership interest in the restructured company. It is not possible, at this point, however, to quantify the value of a recovery on such claim. We may also experience disruption
to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  54 


Table of Contents
In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of
our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including
distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities, reservations and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into
in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no
guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We rely on
third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels. 
We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (GDSs) (e.g.,
Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents and online travel agents (OTAs) (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and The Priceline Group), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and
we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels and hope to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at
present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our call centers and our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute
our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an
industry-competitive cost structure. These imperatives may affect our relationships with GDSs and OTAs, including as consolidation of OTAs continues or is proposed to continue, and require us to make significant investments in potential new
distribution technologies. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business is subject to extensive government
regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages. 
Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has
passed laws, and the DOT, the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a number of directives and other regulations, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial
costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.  For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives
and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to
efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft. Additionally, our failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In the future, new regulatory
requirements could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.  DOT consumer rules that took effect in 2010
require procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers through the reservations process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares
and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. The DOT has been aggressively investigating alleged violations of these rules. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international
airlines.

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of
certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Present and
potential future security requirements can have the effect of imposing costs and inconvenience on travelers, potentially reducing the demand for air travel. 
The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by
changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:   


 

 
 changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at
particular airports, or the types of fees that can be charged to passengers;   


 

 
 the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government
approvals) needed for codesharing alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines;   


 

 
 restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would
curtail an airlines ability to respond to a competitor);   


 

 
 the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards (for
example, a passenger bill of rights);   


 

 
 restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or
reallocation of slot rights currently held by us; and   


 

 
 the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions. 
Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline
operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us. 
Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the U.S. or overseas could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the United States National Airspace System (the ATC system) is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic
controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that are routinely overwhelmed and compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. The ATC systems inability to handle existing travel demand has led
government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. The outdated technologies also cause the ATC to be less
resilient in the event of a failure. For example, in 2014 the ATC systems in Chicago took weeks to recover following a fire in the ATC tower at ORD, which resulted in thousands of cancelled flights. 
The FAA has embarked on transforming the national airspace system, to include migration from the current radar-based air
traffic control system to a GPS-based system. This ATC modernization, generally referred to as NextGen, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains uncertain when the full array of
benefits expected from ATC modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements that may be imposed on airlines of a modernized ATC system may
have a material adverse effect on our business. We support legislative efforts that would establish a nimble not-for-profit entity better suited to manage the long-term
investments in technology and provide a governance structure needed to successfully implement NextGen and improve the operation of the air traffic control system. 
Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective
countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction
and regulations of various foreign agencies. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve are subject to periodic renegotiation. We currently operate a number of international routes
under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy
were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing
joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took
effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each others markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU, including London Heathrow Airport (LHR).
As a result of the agreement, we face increased competition in these markets, including LHR. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route
authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations. The U.S. government has negotiated open skies agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access
between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.

The airline industry is heavily taxed. 
The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability.
The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For
example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees
and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the ticket tax, on domestic and international air
transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although
these taxes and fees are not operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on
airlines and their passengers, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers.
Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus
our revenues.  Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may
cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.  We have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the
future, changes to our business model to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include premium economy service, basic economy service and charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket
and increasing other pre-existing fees. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional
initiatives. We cannot assure you that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational
performance of our airline. Also, any new and increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel
costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges. 
The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified
personnel could adversely affect our business.  We believe that our future success will depend in large part on
our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant
numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing
security concerns.  Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars
or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and attempted attacks
materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of September 11, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs
for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security
screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and enhanced
background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul
travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. Implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers, and have
caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. We have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on
our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. As a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput to support the pace of our operations, it is unlikely that we will be
able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business.

We operate a global business with international operations that are
subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control. 
We operate a global business with operations outside of the U.S. Our current international activities and prospects have been
and in the future could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market,
exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international
government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. In particular, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the
repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. 
Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect
the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.  The United Kingdom held a referendum in June 2016 regarding its membership in the EU in which a
majority of the United Kingdom electorate voted in favor of the British government taking the necessary action for the United Kingdom to leave the EU. In March 2017, the United Kingdom served notice of its decision to withdraw to the EU, formally
initiating the withdrawal process. Serving this notice began the two-year period for the United Kingdom to negotiate the terms for its withdrawal from the EU. At this time, it is not certain what steps will
need to be taken to facilitate the United Kingdoms exit from the EU. The implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the EU are similarly unclear at present because it is unclear what relationship the United Kingdom will have with the
EU after withdrawal. We face risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum and the consequences that may flow from the decision to exit the EU. Among other things, the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could adversely affect
European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. In addition, the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially
divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other
matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. The impact on our business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing EU counterparts cannot be
predicted. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.
 We are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances
relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste
materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. 
  58 


Table of Contents
We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those
that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for
investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental
contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
business.  We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and
other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, in some cases even if we are not
the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, where such indemnities are generally joint and several among the
participating airlines.  Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already
implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be
adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.  We are subject to risks
associated with climate change, including increased regulation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  There is
increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, in October 2016, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) passed a resolution adopting the ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for
International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA was supported by the board of Airlines For America (the principal U.S. airline trade association)
and IATA (the principal international airline trade association), and by American and many other U.S. and foreign airlines. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for American and most other airlines, including other U.S. airlines that operate
internationally, but the implementation of a global program, as compared to regional emission reduction schemes, should help to ensure that these costs will be more predictable and more evenly applied to American and its competitors. The CORSIA is
expected to be implemented in phases, beginning in 2021. Certain details still need to be developed and the impact of the CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. While we do not anticipate any significant emissions allowance expenditures in 2017,
compliance with the CORSIA or similar emissions-related requirements could significantly increase our operating costs beyond 2017. Further, the potential impact of the CORSIA or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately
depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets and the number of future flights subject to such emissions-related requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could
fluctuate.  In addition, in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCCs COP21), over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. While there is no express reference to aviation in this international agreement, to
the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations, either with respect to the aviation industry or with respect to related industries such as the aviation fuel industry, it could
have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued an
endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which is a precursor to EPA regulation of aircraft engine GHG emission standards.
It is anticipated that any such standards established by the EPA would closely align with emission standards currently being developed by ICAO. In February 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended that ICAO adopt
carbon dioxide certification standards that would apply to new type aircraft certified beginning in 2020, and would be phased in for newly manufactured existing aircraft type designs starting in 2023. 
In addition, several states have adopted or are considering initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the
planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the scope of such regulation, certain of our facilities and operations, or the operations of our suppliers, may be subject to additional
operating and other permit requirements, likely resulting in increased operating costs.

These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S. at the federal and
state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the U.S., the EU or in other areas in which we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the
future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including
fuel costs.  We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these
technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are highly
dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems,
telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of
traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets.
We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our automated systems are not functioning or if our
third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our
business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised,
replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. 
Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against other events that are beyond our control, including natural
disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in
our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these systems
could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems. 
Among the principal risks of integrating our businesses and operations are the risks relating to integrating various computer,
communications and other technology systems that will be necessary to operate US Airways and American as a single airline and to achieve cost synergies by eliminating redundancies in the businesses. While we have to date successfully integrated
several of our systems, including our customer reservations system and our pilot and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration projects. The integration of these systems in a number of prior
airline mergers has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecast. The implementation process to integrate these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware,
software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.  We cannot
assure you that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could
result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident, accident involving our personnel or
aircraft or the personnel or aircraft of our regional or codeshare operators.  If our personnel or one of our
aircraft, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident,
accident or catastrophe, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident or catastrophe. In the event that our
insurance is inapplicable or not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident accident or catastrophe involving our personnel or one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of
our regional operators and our codeshare partners) could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners,
and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet
capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate.
In many cases, the aircraft we intend to operate are not yet in our fleet, but we have contractual commitments to purchase or lease them. If for any reason we were unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled
delivery dates, this could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some
leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in
increased maintenance costs. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with
respect to fuel efficiency and reliability, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. 
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. As a result, we
are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the suppliers, or adverse perception by the public that would result in
customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft.  Our business has been
and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. 
Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing
economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:   


 

 
 actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial
conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;   


 

 
 changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends; 
 


 

 
 changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance
affiliations, and other factors;   


 

 
 actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems; 
 


 

 
 increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures; 
 


 

 
 outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and 
 


 

 
 weather and natural disasters. 
In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing
revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition,
due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.

Table of Contents
A higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time
regulations, increased flight hour requirements for commercial airline pilots and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots which could materially adversely affect our business. 
We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Among other things, the extension of pilot
careers facilitated by the FAAs 2007 modification of the mandatory retirement age from age 60 to age 65 has now been fully implemented, resulting in large numbers of pilots in the industry approaching the revised mandatory retirement age.
Further, in July 2013, the FAA issued regulations that increased the flight hours required for pilots working for airlines certificated under Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. In addition, on January 4, 2014, more stringent pilot
flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation Regulations took effect. These and other factors, including reductions in the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial
pilots upon their retirement from military service, have contributed to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required
by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. The foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers to hire
pilots to replace retiring pilots. We believe that this industry-wide pilot shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the United States. Our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet
their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a
material adverse effect on our business.  Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
adversely impact our operations and financial results.  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a
significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current
prices remains uncertain. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the
claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to
pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position
and liquidity.  From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and
government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not
yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not
within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in
significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or
types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain
legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  Our ability to utilize
our NOL Carryforwards may be limited.  Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a
corporation is generally allowed a deduction for NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December 31, 2016, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $10.5 billion for regular federal income tax
purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022, and approximately $3.7 billion for state income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, between 2017 and 2036. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal
Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities. 
  62 


Table of Contents
A corporations ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to
utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an ownership change as defined in Section 382
(generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and US Airways
Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain
special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $8.9 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December 31, 2016) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the
annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL
Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries) are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained
as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect
on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate of Incorporation) contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the
ability of certain holders of AAG common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership
change will not occur even with these restrictions in place.  Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on
the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them. 
We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never
realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges. 
Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually. In accordance with applicable accounting
standards, we are required to assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In addition, we are required to assess certain of our
other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.  Future impairment of
goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of
goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result
from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
The price of AAG common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile. 
The market price of AAG common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our
control, including:   


 

 
 AAGs operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or
investors;   


 

 
 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; 
 


 

 
 material announcements by us or our competitors; 
 


 

 
 movements in fuel prices; 
 


 

 
 expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including our share repurchase program and any future
dividend payments that may be declared by our Board of Directors;   


 

 
 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;

We cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs or continue to
pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.
 Since July 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our Board of Directors has approved six share
repurchase programs aggregating $11.0 billion of authority. As of March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our share repurchase programs
may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any
specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions,
applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase programs may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
Although our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in July 2014 as part of our capital deployment
program, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed
period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends
based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will be able to pay dividends
in the future.  In addition, repurchases of AAG common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs and any future
dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market
liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase programs and any future dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and
acquisitions. Further, our share repurchase programs may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is
no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness.

Certain provisions of AAGs Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial. 
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) may have the effect of
delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following: 
 


 

 
 advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders meetings;
  


 

 
 the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board; 
 


 

 
 a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent; 
 


 

 
 a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; 
 


 

 
 a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election
of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval; and   


 

 
 super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of
Incorporation.  These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and
maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to
prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the
Board of Directors prior to the investment under Section 203.  AAGs Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.  Our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include certain provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock and our other
equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of AAG common stock and our other equity interests.

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Agreement (the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an
Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable
thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance
(including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and,
provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as
a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity
Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity
Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid when due under Section 3.07. 
Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider
Advance shall be deposited in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject
to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider Advance, interest on the principal amount of any
such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying
interest on the Class AA Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an Applied Downgrade
Advance and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and together with an Applied
Downgrade Advance, an Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest
payable thereon; provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance shall
thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the
Class AA Cash Collateral Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus interest on the
principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07.  (b)    At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or
Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class AA 
  12 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause fourth of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor Agreement (any such amount being a Replenishment
Amount) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and Applied Special Termination
Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such
Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount. 
(c)    Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed
to the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not
to exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
 Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In
order to provide for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to
the Liquidity Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of
Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the
Borrower hereunder.  Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances. 
  13 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments
to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the
Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof
after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class AA Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower in writing before the 25th day prior to an anniversary date of the Closing Date that is
prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class AA Certificates (such notification, a Non-Extension
Notice; the date of such notification, the Notice Date) that its obligation to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the
Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the Notice Date (but prior to such anniversary date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE III  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER  Section 3.01    Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03,
if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation
to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect
thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07
and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider
describing in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower 
  14 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on
the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or
attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this
Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim
in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall
not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to
the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is
effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01:
(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity Providers jurisdiction of
organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated or issued by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and International framework for
liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises
through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving
rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar
increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry. 
Section 3.02    Intentionally omitted.

Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to
the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld, (ii) without
duplication of any rights created by Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after
deduction or withholding of all Covered Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a
payment to the relevant authorities furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider,
within 10 Business Days of demand therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto. If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (consistent with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may
thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise
available to it as a result of, any Taxes for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund
(and any interest thereon), net of any related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the
Liquidity Provider the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund
to such governmental or taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which
would place the Liquidity Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax
benefit had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
The Liquidity Provider will (i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to
Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S. taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form
or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions 
  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding
of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or
becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of Covered Taxes.  If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be
necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the
holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes.

Section 3.04    Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the
Borrower shall make or cause to be made each payment to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. The
Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account set forth below or such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have
been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR
Advance) or reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance. 
Section 3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be
paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the
date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class AA Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class AA Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied
Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class AA Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder
(whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to
but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



amount, as the case may be, as in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the
absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the
circumstances giving 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to
as the Applicable Liquidity Rate.  Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower.
Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective
date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider
by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder. 
Section 3.09    Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the
request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of: 
(1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date for borrowing
specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02.  Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be
converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the
expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is
reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to
lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all
commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any
action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action
is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE IV  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

Provider, and the Liquidity Provider shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any damages suffered by the Borrower that were the result of (A) the Liquidity Providers willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether
documents presented hereunder comply with the terms hereof or (B) any breach by the Liquidity Provider of any of the terms of this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Liquidity Providers failure to
make lawful payment hereunder after the delivery to it by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing complying with the terms and conditions hereof. In no event, however, shall the Liquidity Provider be liable on any theory of liability for any special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).

documents which may be delivered in connection herewith or therewith (whether or not the same shall become effective) or any waiver or consent thereunder (whether or not the same shall be effective), unless such costs or expenses arise as a result
of the negligence of the Liquidity Provider or any breach by the Liquidity Provider of its obligations under any Operative Agreement. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all recording, stamp and other similar taxes and fees payable or

benefit of the Borrower and the Liquidity Provider and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither the Liquidity Provider (except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.08) nor (except as contemplated by
Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Providers right to grant Participations pursuant to Section
7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended and (iii) such Participation shall not be made to any Person that is a commercial air

shall have no rights or benefits as against American or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such
obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its
participants. Accordingly, in determining 
  27 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class AA) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and
capital adequacy requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are
commercial banking institutions and of whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a
Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the
Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a
Participation, it shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest
in this Agreement.  (c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant
shall (i) represent to the Liquidity Provider (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties, no taxes will be required to be withheld with respect to any income derived by such participant
from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service certifying, in each case, such participants entitlement to a complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered
by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal
withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower)
to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations
of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such
participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is confidential.

Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law. 
(b)    THE BORROWER AND THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED, including, without limitation, contract claims, tort

accordance with Section 2.06 and for the purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on
the Class A Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement 
  11 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



(the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an
Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable
thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance
(including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and,
provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as
a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity
Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity
Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid when due under Section 3.07. 
Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider
Advance shall be deposited in the Class A Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to
Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider Advance, interest on the principal amount of any such
Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest
on the Class A Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an Applied Downgrade Advance and
(z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an
Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon;
provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance shall thereafter be treated
as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the Class A Cash Collateral
Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus interest on the principal amount so repaid as
provided in Section 3.07.  (b) At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion
thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class A 
  12 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause fourth of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor Agreement (any such amount being a Replenishment
Amount) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and Applied Special Termination
Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such
Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount. 
(c)    Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class A Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed to
the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to
exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
 Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to provide
for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity
Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II
and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the Borrower
hereunder.  Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances. 
  13 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments
to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the
Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof
after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class A Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower in writing before the 25th day prior to an anniversary date of the Closing Date that is
prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class A Certificates (such notification, a Non-Extension
Notice; the date of such notification, the Notice Date) that its obligation to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the
Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the Notice Date (but prior to such anniversary date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE III  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER  Section 3.01 Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03, if as a result of any Regulatory
Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation to make any such Advances or
there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect thereof, and in case of either
such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the
Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower
shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail
the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower 
  14 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on
the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or
attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this
Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim
in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall
not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to
the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is
effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01:
(a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity Providers jurisdiction of
organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated or issued by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and International framework for
liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises
through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving
rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar
increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.

Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 3.02    Intentionally omitted. 
Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this
Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld, (ii) without duplication of any rights created by
Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered
Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a payment to the relevant authorities
furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider, within 10 Business Days of demand
therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with
applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise available to it as a result of, any Taxes
for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon), net of any
related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the Liquidity Provider the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund to such governmental or taxing
authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which would place the Liquidity
Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax benefit had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to make available its Tax returns (or
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  The Liquidity Provider will
(i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S.
taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions

  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding
of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or
becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of Covered Taxes.  If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be
necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the
holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes.

Section 3.04    Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the
Borrower shall make or cause to be made each payment to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. The
Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account set forth below or such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to
be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have been made
when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR Advance) or
reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance.  Section
3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date
of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class A Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class A
Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class A Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in
respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue
and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



be, as in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law;
provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any
subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the absolute amount of
interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the
circumstances giving 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next
succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to
as the Applicable Liquidity Rate.  Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower.
Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective
date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider
by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder. 
Section 3.09    Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the
request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits
or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of: 
(1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date for borrowing
specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02.  Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be
converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the
expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is
reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to
such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially
reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class A) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any
action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action
is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE IV  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
 Section 4.01    Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of Section 2.01. Section 2.01 of this
Agreement shall become effective on and as of the first date (the Effective Date) on which the following conditions precedent have been satisfied (or waived by the appropriate party or parties): 
(a) The Liquidity Provider shall have received on or before the date hereof each of the following, and in the case of each document delivered

Provider, and the Liquidity Provider shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any damages suffered by the Borrower that were the result of (A) the Liquidity Providers willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether
documents presented hereunder comply with the terms hereof or (B) any breach by the Liquidity Provider of any of the terms of this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Liquidity Providers failure to
make lawful payment hereunder after the delivery to it by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing complying with the terms and conditions hereof. In no event, however, shall the Liquidity Provider be liable on any theory of liability for any special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).

expenses) of the Liquidity Provider in connection with the modification or amendment of, or supplement to, this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement or such other documents which may be delivered in connection herewith or therewith (whether or
not the same shall become effective) or any waiver or consent thereunder (whether or not the same shall be effective), unless such costs or expenses arise as a result of the negligence of the Liquidity Provider or any breach by the Liquidity
Provider of its obligations under any Operative Agreement. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all recording, stamp and other similar taxes and fees payable or

benefit of the Borrower and the Liquidity Provider and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither the Liquidity Provider (except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.08) nor (except as contemplated by
Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Providers right to grant Participations pursuant to Section
7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended and (iii) such Participation shall not be made to any Person that is a commercial air

obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its
participants. Accordingly, in determining 
  27

capital adequacy requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are
commercial banking institutions and of whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a
Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the
Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a
Participation, it shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest
in this Agreement.  (c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant
shall (i) represent to the Liquidity Provider (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties, no taxes will be required to be withheld with respect to any income derived by such participant
from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service certifying, in each case, such participants entitlement to a complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form
W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate
or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered
by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal
withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower)
to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations
of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such
participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is confidential.

Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law. 
(b)    THE BORROWER AND THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY

such Interest Advances have been made, starting with the earliest), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the
Liquidity Provider shall make a Provider Advance at any time after making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become a Downgraded
Facility or Non-Extended Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment to zero, then such Interest Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances
and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the
purpose of determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with Section 2.06 and for the

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of
paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the
outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining
the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to
Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance (including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable
Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and, provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied
Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange
for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid
when due under Section 3.07.  Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts
advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider Advance shall be deposited in the Class B Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and
3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider
Advance, interest on the principal amount of any such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash
Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an
Applied Downgrade Advance and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an Applied Non-Extension Advance and
together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an Applied Provider Advance) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable
Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such
Provider Advance shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any
amounts from the Class B Cash Collateral Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus
interest on the principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07.

Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


(b)    At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special
Termination Advance (or any portion thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause fourth of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor Agreement (any such amount being
a Replenishment Amount) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and
Applied Special Termination Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by
the amount of such Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount. 
(c)    Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance on the date of such
replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 
(d)    If at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers
a written notice to that effect to the Borrower and American, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed to
the Liquidity Provider and (ii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, the Maximum Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to
exceed the Maximum Commitment and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, and the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment shall no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance.
 Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to provide
for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity
Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance
of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II
and III of the Intercreditor Agreement (or, if not provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, then in such manner as the Liquidity Provider shall deem appropriate) and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the Borrower
hereunder.  Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof;
provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances. 
  13 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments
to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the
Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof
after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in
Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower in writing before the 25th day prior to an anniversary date of the Closing Date that is
prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class B Certificates (such notification, a Non-Extension
Notice; the date of such notification, the Notice Date) that its obligation to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the
Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the Notice Date (but prior to such anniversary date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 
ARTICLE III  OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER  Section 3.01    Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03,
if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation
to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect
thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an Increased Cost), then, subject to Sections 2.07
and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after 
  14 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



delivery to the Borrower and American of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the
basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such
certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity
Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim
under this Section 3.01 in respect of or attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the
Liquidity Provider to compensation under this Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any
such claim; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal
policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider
therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, American may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section
3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make
payments under this Section 3.01: (a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity
Providers jurisdiction of organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
promulgated or issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) including, but not limited to the Consultative Documents entitled Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and
International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, each dated December 2009 or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in
respect of an Increased Cost arises through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule,
regulation or interpretation giving rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not
also seeking payment for similar increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry.

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


Section 3.02    Intentionally omitted. 
Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this
Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall (i) deduct or withhold and shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld , (ii) without duplication of any rights created by
Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered
Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required and (iii) within 30 days after the date of a payment to the relevant authorities
furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other reasonable evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Liquidity Provider, within 10 Business Days of demand
therefor the full amount of Covered Taxes paid or payable by the Liquidity Provider in respect of payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
If the Borrower provides a written request (which shall be considered prior written consent under subsection (vi) of the definition of Covered Taxes), the Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with
applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of, or realizes a net Tax benefit not otherwise available to it as a result of, any Taxes
for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon), net of any
related out-of-pocket expenses, or net benefit. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the Liquidity Provider the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (a) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund to such governmental or taxing
authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (a), in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (a) the payment of which would place the Liquidity
Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund or net Tax benefit had not been deducted,
withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph (a) shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to make available its Tax returns (or
any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  The Liquidity Provider will
(i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed originals of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S.
taxpayer 
  16 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that
such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver
to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. 
If a payment made to the Liquidity Provider or Borrower hereunder would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the
Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), it shall deliver to
the Borrower or the Liquidity Provider, as applicable, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Liquidity Provider, as applicable, as may be necessary for the Borrower or Liquidity
Provider, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Liquidity Provider or Borrower has complied with the Liquidity Providers or Borrowers obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to
deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(b)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time
prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such
reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the
Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified
copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment.  On or before the Closing Date, the
Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, showing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any other
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of
the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or 
  17

(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the
Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes. 
Section 3.04    Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall make or cause to be made each
payment to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. The Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to
the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account set forth below or such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the Subordination Agent:

 Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 
Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have
been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR
Advance) or reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance. 
Section 3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause
to be paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including
the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class B Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied
Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class B Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder
(whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to
but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such 
  18 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may be, as
in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise
applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate
of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon)
if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 
(b)    Each Advance will be either a Base Rate Advance or a LIBOR Advance as provided in this Section 3.07. Each such
Advance will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Providers receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall
be a LIBOR Advance; provided that a Provider Advance shall always be a LIBOR Advance.  (c)    Each LIBOR
Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the
event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 
(d)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of
interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid).  (e)    Intentionally omitted. 
(f)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of
interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 
(g)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally, the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a Rate Determination
Notice) to the Borrower. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the
Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be 
  19 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the circumstances giving rise to
such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. Each
change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to as the Applicable Liquidity Rate. 
Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower. Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the
successor Borrowers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of
Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent) delivered to the Liquidity Provider by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated
therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder.  Section 3.09    Funding Loss
Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss,
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred
as a result of:  (1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Advance; or  (2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on
the date for borrowing specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02. 
Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law,
rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to
maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and American by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the
Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of
any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and American as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances
under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or American of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will
lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity 
  20 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such
designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the
Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or American agrees to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for

in this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fee Letter or any other Operative Agreement to which it is a party or (iv) otherwise excluded from the indemnification provisions

be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any damages suffered by the Borrower that were the result of (A) the Liquidity Providers willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented hereunder comply with
the terms hereof or (B) any breach by the Liquidity Provider of any of the terms of this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Liquidity Providers failure to make lawful payment hereunder after the
delivery to it by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing complying with the terms and conditions hereof. In no event, however, shall the Liquidity Provider be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).  (b)    Neither the
Liquidity Provider nor any of its officers, employees or directors or affiliates shall be liable or responsible in any respect for (i) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice,
however transmitted, in connection with this Agreement or any Notice of Borrowing delivered hereunder or (ii) any action, inaction or omission which may be taken by it in good faith, absent willful misconduct or gross negligence (in which event
the extent of the Liquidity Providers potential liability to the Borrower shall be limited as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph), in connection with this Agreement or any Notice of Borrowing. 
Section 7.07    Certain Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees promptly to pay, or cause to be paid,

documents which may be delivered in connection herewith or therewith (whether or not the same shall become effective) or any waiver or consent thereunder (whether or not the same shall be effective), unless such costs or expenses arise as a result
of the negligence of the Liquidity Provider or any breach by 
  26 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



the Liquidity Provider of its obligations under any Operative Agreement. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all recording, stamp and other similar taxes and fees payable or determined to
be payable in the United States in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement, any other Operative Agreement and such other documents, and agrees to save the Liquidity Provider harmless from and against any and
all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes or fees. 
Section 7.08    Binding Effect; Participations. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower and the Liquidity Provider and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither the Liquidity Provider (except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.08) nor (except as contemplated by
Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Providers right to grant Participations pursuant to Section
7.08(b).  (b)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without
limitation, a risk participation) (any such participation, a Participation) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied (and, if all such conditions are satisfied with respect to any Participation, the Liquidity Provider may grant such Participation): (i) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests, (ii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that
require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended and (iii) such Participation shall not be made to any Person that is a commercial air
carrier, American or any affiliate of American. Notwithstanding any such Participation, the Liquidity Provider agrees that (1) the Liquidity Providers obligations under the Operative Agreements shall remain unchanged, and such participant
shall have no rights or benefits as against American or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such
obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the
Liquidity Providers rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall
hold the Borrower and American and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed
Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection
therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and
American to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein 
  27 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 



(subject to customary exceptions). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Providers source of funds may derive in part from its participants. Accordingly, in determining
amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and capital adequacy requirements, increased costs,
reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 and the like as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are commercial banking institutions and of whose
participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and
references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, neither American nor the Borrower shall be required to pay any amount
under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. If the Liquidity Provider sells a Participation, it shall, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in this Agreement. 
(c)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that, as a condition of any Participation, the participant shall (i) represent
to the Liquidity Provider (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties, no taxes will be required to be withheld with respect to any income derived by such participant from the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements, (ii) furnish to the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower two properly completed executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
certifying, in each case, such participants entitlement to a complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements,
(iii) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide each of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower a new Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-9, as appropriate, or other applicable form, certificate or document (A) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or document
expires or becomes obsolete or (B) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form, certificate or document previously delivered by it and prior to the immediately following due date of any payment to be made to the
participant pursuant to the Operative Agreements, certifying that such participant is entitled to a complete exemption from or reduction in United States federal withholding tax and backup withholding for all income derived by it from the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or that it is no longer so entitled and (iv) agree (for the benefit of the Liquidity Provider and the Borrower) to provide such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that all income derived by it from the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. The Liquidity Provider shall provide to
the Borrower such information as the Borrower may reasonably request about the Liquidity Provider or a participant to satisfy any reporting or other Tax obligations of the Borrower with respect to this Agreement; provided that the Liquidity
Provider shall not be required to provide any such information (other than the names of participants, percentage of participation and copies of such participants withholding tax forms) which is not within its possession or which is
confidential. 
  28 
Revolving Credit Agreement (Class B) 
(American Airlines 2017-1 Aircraft EETC) 


(d)    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.08, the
Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the
Borrowers obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
Section 7.10    Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE. 
Section 7.11    Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Waiver of Immunity. (a) Each of the
parties hereto, to the extent it may do so under applicable law, for purposes hereof hereby (i) irrevocably submits itself to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting
in the City of New York and to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of

defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts, (iii) agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or
any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to each party hereto at its address set forth in Section 7.02 hereof, or at such other address of which the Liquidity Provider shall have been notified pursuant thereto and
(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law. 
(b)    THE BORROWER AND THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED, including, without limitation, contract claims, tort

THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT. 
(c)    To the extent that the Liquidity Provider or any of its properties has or may hereafter acquire any right of

elsewhere, to enforce or collect upon this Agreement, including, without limitation, immunity from suit or service of process, immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any court or tribunal or execution of a judgment, or immunity of any of its
property from attachment prior to any entry of judgment, or from attachment in aid of execution upon a judgment, the Liquidity Provider hereby irrevocably and expressly waives any such immunity, and agrees not to assert any such right or claim in
any such proceeding, whether in the United States or elsewhere.  Section 7.12    Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (and each party shall not be required to execute the same counterpart). Each counterpart of this Agreement including a signature page or pages executed by each of the parties hereto shall be an
original counterpart of this Agreement, but all of such counterparts together shall constitute one instrument.

principal amount of any Incremental Term Loans of the same Class as the 2017 Replacement Term Loans from time to time after the Second Amendment Effective Date, on each anniversary of the Closing Date occurring prior to the Term Loan
Maturity Date with respect to such 2017 Replacement Term Loans commencing on June 27, 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) such Installments shall be reduced in connection with any mandatory or voluntary prepayments of
the 2017 Replacement Term Loans in accordance with Sections 2.12 and 2.13, as applicable and (2) the Term Loans, together with all other amounts owed hereunder with respect thereto, shall, in any event, be paid in full no later
than the applicable Term Loan Termination Date.  (xx)    Section 2.13(a) is hereby amended by adding the
following sentence at the end thereof:  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, no notice to the Administrative
Agent shall be required in connection with the repayment of the Existing Term Loans (as defined in the Second Amendment) with the proceeds of 2017 Replacement Term Loans incurred on the Second Amendment Effective Date. 
(xxi)    Section 2.13(d) is hereby amended by (A) deleting 2015 Term Loans each place it appears and
replacing it with 2017 Replacement Term Loans and (B) deleting Restatement Effective Date and replacing it with Second Amendment Effective Date. 
(xxii)    Section 2.19 is hereby amended by deleting dated as of May 6, 2015 by and between the Borrower
and the Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners where it appears and replacing it with dated as of March 3, 2017 by and between the Borrower and the Agents (as defined therein). 
(xxiii)    Section 2.27(c) is hereby amended by deleting 2015 Term Loans each place it appears and
replacing it with 2017 Replacement Term Loans.  (xxiv)    Section 3.16 is hereby amended by deleting
and no such reports have been made. 
  8 


(xxv)    A new Section 10.19 is added as follows: 
Section 10.19 Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an EEA Financial
Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 (a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any
such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an EEA Financial Institution; and 
(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability,
including, if applicable:  (i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such
liability;  (ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu
of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down
and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.  (b)    (i) Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the
conditions set forth in Section Three hereof, the Replacement Term Lenders hereby agree to make 2017 Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to the Borrower on the Second Amendment Effective Date (as defined below) in the aggregate
principal amount of $1,843,415,625, which shall be used solely to refinance in full all outstanding Existing Term Loans. 
(ii)    As of the Second Amendment Effective Date, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment, the
Administrative Agent has prepared and provided a true and correct copy to the Borrower of a schedule (the 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitments Schedule) which sets forth the allocated commitments received by it (the
2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitments) from the Lenders providing the 2017 Replacement Term Loans. The Administrative Agent has notified each Replacement Term Lender of its allocated 2017 Replacement Term Loan
Commitment, and each of the Replacement Term Lenders is listed as a signatory to this Second Amendment. On the Second Amendment Effective Date, all Existing Term Loans shall be refinanced in full as follows: 
(w)    the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of each Lender which does not have
a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (each, a Non-Converting Term Lender) shall be repaid in full in cash; 
  9 


(x)    to the extent any Lender has a 2017 Replacement
Term Loan Commitment that is less than the full outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of such Lender, such Lender shall be repaid in cash in an amount equal to the difference between the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of Existing Term Loans of such Lender and such Lenders 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (the Non-Converting Term Portion); 
(y)    the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of each Lender which has
a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment (each, a Converting Term Lender, and, together with the Non-Converting Term Lenders, the Existing Term Lenders) shall
automatically be converted into 2017 Replacement Term Loans (a Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loan) in a principal amount equal to such Converting Term Lenders Existing Term Loans outstanding on the
Second Amendment Effective Date immediately prior to such conversion, less an amount equal to any Non-Converting Term Portion; and 
(z)    (1) each Replacement Term Lender that is not an Existing Term Lender (each, a New Term
Lender) and (2) each Converting Term Lender with a 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment in an amount in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans of such Converting Term Lender (such difference, the
New Term Commitment), agrees to make to the Borrower a new Term Loan (each, a New Term Loan and, collectively, the New Term Loans and, together with the Converted 2017 Replacement Term
Loans, the 2017 Replacement Term Loans) in a principal amount equal to such Converting Term Lenders New Term Commitment or such New Term Lenders 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment, as the case may be, on the
Second Amendment Effective Date, which 2017 Replacement Term Loans shall be subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement after giving effect to this Second Amendment. 
(iii)    On the Second Amendment Effective Date, each Replacement Term Lender hereby agrees to fund its 2017
Replacement Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Replacement Term Lenders 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment as follows: (x) each Converting Term Lender shall fund its 2017 Replacement Term Loans to the
Borrower by converting its then outstanding principal amount of Existing Term Loans into 2017 Replacement Term Loans in an equal principal amount as provided in clause (ii)(y) above, (y) (1) each Converting Term Lender with a New Term
Commitment shall fund in cash an amount equal to its New Term Commitment to the Designated Replacement Term Lender and (2) each New Term Lender shall fund in cash an amount equal to its 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment to the
Designated Replacement Term Lender, and (z) the Designated Replacement Term Lender shall fund in cash to the Borrower an amount equal to the New Term Commitment of each Converting Term Lender and the 2017 Replacement Term Loan Commitment
of each New Term Lender. 
  10 


(iv)    All outstanding Borrowings of Existing Term Loans shall continue in
effect for the equivalent principal amount of 2017 Replacement Term Loans after the Second Amendment Effective Date and each resulting borrowing of 2017 Replacement Term Loans shall be deemed to constitute a new deemed
borrowing under the Credit Agreement and be subject to the same Interest Period (and the same LIBO Rate) applicable to the Existing Term Loans to which it relates immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date, which Interest
Period shall continue in effect (until such Interest Periods expire, at which time subsequent Interest Periods shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.05 of the Credit Agreement). New Term Loans shall be initially
incurred as Eurodollar Loans and shall be allocated ratably to the outstanding deemed borrowings of 2017 Replacement Term Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date. Each such Borrowing of New Term Loans shall be subject to
(x) an Interest Period which commences on the Second Amendment Effective Date and ends on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Existing Term Loans and (y) the same LIBO Rate applicable to the 2017 Replacement Term
Loans. The 2017 Replacement Term Loans of each Replacement Term Lender shall be allocated ratably to such Interest Periods (based upon the relative principal amounts of Borrowings of Existing Term Loans subject to such Interest Periods
immediately prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date), with the effect being that Existing Term Loans which are converted into Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loans hereunder shall continue to be subject to the same Interest Periods and
any 2017 Replacement Term Loans that are funded in cash on the Second Amendment Effective Date shall be ratably allocated to the various Interest Periods as described above. 
(v)    On the Second Amendment Effective Date, the Borrower shall pay in cash (a) all interest accrued on the
Existing Term Loans through the Second Amendment Effective Date and (b) to each Non-Converting Term Lender and each Converting Term Lender with a Non-Converting
Term Portion, any breakage loss or expenses due under Section 2.15 of the Credit Agreement (it being understood that existing Interest Periods of the Existing Term Loans held by Replacement Term Lenders prior to the Second Amendment Effective
Date shall continue on and after the Second Amendment Effective Date and shall accrue interest in accordance with Section 2.07 of the Credit Agreement on and after the Second Amendment Effective Date). Each Converting Term Lender hereby waives
any entitlement to any breakage loss or expenses due under Section 2.15 of the Credit Agreement with respect to the repayment of that portion of its Existing Term Loans with the proceeds of Converted 2017 Replacement Term Loans. 
(vi)    On the Second Amendment Effective Date, all promissory notes, if any, evidencing the Existing Term Loans shall be
automatically cancelled, and any Replacement Term Lender may request that its 2017 Replacement Term Loan be evidenced by a promissory pursuant to Section 2.10(f) of the Credit Agreement. 
SECTION TWO - Titles and Roles. The parties hereto agree that, as of the Second Amendment Effective Date and in connection with
the Second Amendment:  (a)    each of JPMCB, Barclays, Citi, CS Securities, DBSI, GSLP, ML, MS, BNP Securities, CA-CIB, ICBC, US Bank (each as defined in the Engagement Letter dated as of March 3, 2017, by and between, inter alios, the Borrower and the Lead Arrangers (as defined

that any representation or warranty that is qualified by materiality (it being understood that any representation or warranty that excludes circumstances that would not result in a Material Adverse Change or Material Adverse
Effect shall not be considered (for purposes of this proviso) to be qualified by materiality and provided, further, that for purposes of this Section 3(f), the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.04(a) and 3.05(a) of the

  13 



proviso) to be qualified by materiality and provided, further, that for purposes of this Section 4, the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.04(a) and 3.05(a) of the Credit

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial

 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">10-K</font> for the year ended
 December&#xA0;31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font> is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.</p>

 restricted cash equivalents. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-18</font> also requires companies who

 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">10-K</font> for the year ended
 December&#xA0;31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.</p>

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the

 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font> is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for

 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods

 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of

 <i>Chapter 11 Cases</i>. On November&#xA0;29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR&#x2019;s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October&#xA0;21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors&#x2019; fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December&#xA0;9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March&#xA0;31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2&#xA0;million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR
 stockholders.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-pension,</font> postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April&#xA0;18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American&#x2019;s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-union</font> employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees&#x2019; benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. Our
 financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs
 without giving effect to any modification or termination of
 benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome
 of this proceeding.</p>

 <i>DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand</i>. In June 2015, we
 received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into
 whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air
 passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information
 from us, and other airlines have announced that they have received
 similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ
 investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the
 delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
 Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of
 litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as
 defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits
 alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
 capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal
 District Court for the District of Columbia. On October&#xA0;28,
 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to
 dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation
 and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and we
 intend to defend these matters vigorously.</p>

 <i>Private Party Antitrust Action</i>. On July&#xA0;2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section&#xA0;7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August&#xA0;6, 2013, the plaintiffs <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">re-filed</font> their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November&#xA0;27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs&#x2019; motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August&#xA0;19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October&#xA0;15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties&#x2019;
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February&#xA0;22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit
 and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.</p>

 <i>DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service</i>. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry
 regarding American&#x2019;s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the DOJ seeking
 certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has
 also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its
 investigation.</p>

 <i>General</i>. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other
 legal proceedings from time to time.&#xA0;Legal proceedings can be
 complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution,
 with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
 which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will
 vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above
 and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
 potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could
 be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors &#x2013;

 business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position

 $1.5&#xA0;billion remained unused under a repurchase program that
 expires on December&#xA0;31, 2018. Share repurchases under our
 share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods,
 which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated
 transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase
 transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time
 subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal
 requirements and other relevant factors. Our share repurchase
 programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of
 shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.</p>

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. American will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to
 adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective
 method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of
 the new revenue standard will impact its condensed consolidated
 financial statements. American currently expects that the new
 revenue standard will materially impact its liability for
 outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program
 members when flying on American. American currently uses the
 incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty
 program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the
 estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.
 The new revenue standard will require American to change its policy
 and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of
 each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned
 will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future
 mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage
 credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be
 materially greater under the relative selling price approach than
 the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental
 cost method. The new revenue standard will also require American to
 reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are
 currently included within other operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the

 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification

 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. American is currently evaluating how the
 adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed
 consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on American&#x2019;s implementation. Currently, American
 expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a
 material impact on its condensed consolidated balance sheet due to
 the recognition of <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for

 On December&#xA0;9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December&#xA0;30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG&#x2019;s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.</p>

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.</p>

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09,</font> &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2014-09</font> completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December&#xA0;15,
 2017. American will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. American currently expects to
 adopt the new revenue standard using the full retrospective
 method.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 American is still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of
 the new revenue standard will impact its condensed consolidated
 financial statements. American currently expects that the new
 revenue standard will materially impact its liability for
 outstanding mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program
 members when flying on American. American currently uses the
 incremental cost method to account for this portion of its loyalty
 program liability, which values these mileage credits based on the
 estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger.
 The new revenue standard will require American to change its policy
 and apply a relative selling price approach whereby a portion of
 each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned
 will be deferred and recognized in passenger revenue upon future
 mileage redemption. The carrying value of the earned mileage
 credits recognized in loyalty program liability is expected to be
 materially greater under the relative selling price approach than
 the value attributed to these mileage credits under the incremental
 cost method. The new revenue standard will also require American to
 reclassify certain ancillary fees to passenger revenue, which are
 currently included within other operating revenue.</p>

 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2016-02</font> is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. American is currently evaluating how the
 adoption of the new lease standard will impact its condensed
 consolidated financial statements. Interpretations are <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">on-going</font> and could have a material
 impact on American&#x2019;s implementation. Currently, American
 expects that the adoption of the new lease standard will have a
 material impact on its condensed consolidated balance sheet due to
 the recognition of <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap"><font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">right-of-use</font></font> assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for

 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented

 Cost.&#x201D; ASU <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">2017-07</font>
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on
 January&#xA0;1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of American&#x2019;s net periodic benefit cost (income), with the
 exception of service cost, currently reported within operating
 expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and
 reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this
 new standard will have no impact on <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">pre-tax</font> income or net income reported.
 See Note 6 for American&#x2019;s current components of net periodic
 benefit cost (income).</p>

 <b>10. Legal Proceedings</b></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 <i>Chapter 11 Cases</i>. On November&#xA0;29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR&#x2019;s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October&#xA0;21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors&#x2019; fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December&#xA0;9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March&#xA0;31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2&#xA0;million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former
 AMR stockholders.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-pension,</font> postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April&#xA0;18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American&#x2019;s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">non-union</font> employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees&#x2019; benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees.
 American&#x2019;s financial statements presently reflect these
 retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or
 termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based
 upon the outcome of this proceeding.</p>

 <i>DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand</i>. In June 2015,
 American received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the
 United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an
 investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or
 coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and
 other information from American, and other airlines have announced
 that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating
 fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to
 announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along
 with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
 Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air
 Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative
 class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to
 air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in
 the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On
 October&#xA0;28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline
 defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ
 investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early
 stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 <i>Private Party Antitrust Action</i>. On July&#xA0;2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section&#xA0;7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August&#xA0;6, 2013, the plaintiffs <font style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap">re-filed</font> their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November&#xA0;27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs&#x2019; motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August&#xA0;19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October&#xA0;15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties&#x2019;
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February&#xA0;22, 2017. American believes this lawsuit is without
 merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.</p>

 <i>DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service</i>. In April 2015, the DOJ informed American of an inquiry
 regarding American&#x2019;s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ
 seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ
 has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. American is cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to
 its investigation.</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; MARGIN-TOP: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 4%">
 <i>General</i>. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged in
 other legal proceedings from time to time.&#xA0;Legal proceedings
 can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach
 resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of
 variables, some of which are not within American&#x2019;s control.
 Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each
 of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings,
 their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts
 on American are uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item
 1A. Risk Factors &#x2013; &#x201C;<i>We may be a party to litigation
 in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect
 our financial position and liquidity</i>&#x201D; for additional
 discussion.</p>

Basis of Presentation


1. Basis of Presentation

 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 10-K for the year ended
 December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and
 its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG’s principal subsidiary is
 American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany
 transactions have been eliminated.

 On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.

 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.

Leases

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
 842).” ASU 2016-02
 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 right-of-use assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.

Statement of Cash Flows

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash
 Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in
 total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period
 on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
 restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented
 and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
 after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
 financial statements.

Retirement Benefits

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation –
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.” ASU 2017-07
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported
 within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new
 standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.
 See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost
 (income).

 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on American’s condensed
 consolidated financial statements.

Retirement Benefits

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation –
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.” ASU 2017-07
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. American will adopt this standard on
 January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of American’s net periodic benefit cost (income), with the
 exception of service cost, currently reported within operating
 expenses as salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and
 reported within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this
 new standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.
 See Note 6 for American’s current components of net periodic
 benefit cost (income).

Equity [Abstract]
 



Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends


4. Share Repurchase Programs and Dividends
Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has
 approved six share repurchase programs aggregating
 $11.0 billion of authority. As of March 31, 2017,
 $1.5 billion remained unused under a repurchase program that
 expires on December 31, 2018. Share repurchases under our
 share repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods,
 which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated
 transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase
 transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time
 subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal
 requirements and other relevant factors. Our share repurchase
 programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of
 shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017,
 we repurchased 11.7 million shares of AAG common stock for
 $512 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.81.
 Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014,
 we have repurchased 240.0 million shares of AAG common stock
 for $9.5 billion at a weighted average cost per share of
 $39.62.
Our Board of Directors declared the following cash
 dividends during the first quarter of 2017:

Any future dividends that may be declared and paid
 from time to time will be subject to market and economic
 conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
 factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed
 period, and payment of dividends may be suspended at any time at
 our discretion.

2017 Aircraft Financing
 Activities

2017-1 EETCs
In January 2017, American created three
 pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million
 aggregate principal amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and
 Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the
 financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered to American
 through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the
 proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire
 Series AA, A and B equipment notes issued by American to the
 pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held
 in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as
 American issues additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to
 the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional
 equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are
 not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on our
 condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by
 the depository are not American’s assets.

  
As of March 31, 2017, approximately
 $635 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to
 purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal
 payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in
 February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning
 in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018.
 The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.
Certain information regarding the 2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the
 remaining escrowed proceeds of the 2017-1 EETC, as of March 31,
 2017, is set forth in the table below.

 $1.8 billion term loan facility due June 2020 established
 thereunder (the 2013 Term Loan Facility and, together with the
 $1.4 billion revolving credit facility established under such
 agreement, the 2013 Credit Facilities) to reduce the London
 Interbank Offered Rate margin from 2.50% to 2.00% and the base rate

2017 Aircraft Financing
 Activities

2017-1 EETCs
In January 2017, American created three
 pass-through trusts which issued approximately $983 million
 aggregate principal amount of Series 2017-1 Class AA, Class A and
 Class B EETCs (the 2017-1 EETCs) in connection with the
 financing of 24 aircraft scheduled to be delivered to American
 through May 2017 (the 2017-1 Aircraft). A portion of the
 proceeds received from the sale of the 2017-1 EETCs has been used to acquire
 Series AA, A and B equipment notes issued by American to the
 pass-through trusts and the balance of such proceeds is being held
 in escrow for the benefit of the holders of the 2017-1 EETCs until such time as
 American issues additional Series AA, A and B equipment notes to
 the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional
 equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are
 not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its
 condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by
 the depository are not American’s assets.
As of March 31, 2017, approximately
 $635 million of the escrowed proceeds from the 2017-1 EETCs have been used to
 purchase equipment notes issued by American. Interest and principal
 payments on the equipment notes will be payable semi-annually in
 February and August of each year, with interest payments beginning
 in August 2017 and principal payments beginning in February 2018.
 The equipment notes are secured by liens on the 2017-1 Aircraft.
Certain information regarding the 2017-1 EETC equipment notes and the

 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $10.5 billion
 of gross net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior
 taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable
 income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for
 use in 2017. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in
 2022 if unused. We also had approximately $3.7 billion of NOL
 Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at
 December 31, 2016, which will expire in years 2017 through
 2036 if unused.

  

 At December 31, 2016, we had an alternative minimum tax credit
 carryforward of approximately $339 million available for
 federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite
 period.

 In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax provision
 of $131 million, which was substantially non-cash due to the utilization of the
 NOLs described above. Substantially all of our income before income
 taxes is attributable to the United States.

Legal Proceedings


11. Legal Proceedings

Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.

 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, we are not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR
 stockholders.

 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees. Our
 financial statements presently reflect these retirement programs
 without giving effect to any modification or termination of
 benefits that may ultimately be implemented based upon the outcome
 of this proceeding.

DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015, we
 received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States
 Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an investigation into
 whether there have been illegal agreements or coordination of air
 passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and other information
 from us, and other airlines have announced that they have received
 similar requests. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ
 investigation. In addition, subsequent to announcement of the
 delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, we, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
 Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of
 litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, have been named as
 defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits
 alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger
 capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in the Federal
 District Court for the District of Columbia. On October 28,
 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline defendants to
 dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ investigation
 and these lawsuits are in their relatively early stages and we
 intend to defend these matters vigorously.

  

Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties’
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February 22, 2017. We believe this lawsuit is without merit
 and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.

DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed us of an inquiry
 regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, we received a CID from the DOJ seeking
 certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ has
 also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is
 investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other
 statutes. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ with regard to its
 investigation.

General. In addition to the specifically identified legal
 proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other
 legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings can be
 complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution,
 with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of
 which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will
 vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above
 and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and
 potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could
 be material. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors –
 “We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of
 business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position
 and liquidity” for additional discussion.

Legal Proceedings


10. Legal Proceedings

Chapter 11 Cases. On November 29, 2011, AMR, American,
 and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic
 subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief
 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
 States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
 Bankruptcy Court). On October 21, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court
 entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth
 amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the
 Effective Date, December 9, 2013, the Debtors consummated
 their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the
 Merger.

 Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established
 the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock
 reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective
 Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. As of
 March 31, 2017, there were approximately 25.2 million
 shares of AAG common stock remaining in the Disputed Claims
 Reserve. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants will
 receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve on
 the same basis as if such distributions had been made on or about
 the Effective Date. However, American is not required to distribute
 additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even
 if the shares remaining for distribution are not sufficient to
 fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent
 that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon
 resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not
 be returned to American but rather will be distributed to former
 AMR stockholders.

 There is also pending in the Bankruptcy Court an adversary
 proceeding relating to an action brought by American to seek a
 determination that certain non-pension, postemployment benefits
 are not vested benefits and thus may be modified or terminated
 without liability to American. On April 18, 2014, the
 Bankruptcy Court granted American’s motion for summary
 judgment with respect to certain non-union employees, concluding that
 their benefits were not vested and could be terminated. The summary
 judgment motion was denied with respect to all other retirees. The
 Bankruptcy Court has not yet scheduled a trial on the merits
 concerning whether those retirees’ benefits are vested, and
 American cannot predict whether it will receive relief from
 obligations to provide benefits to any of those retirees.
 American’s financial statements presently reflect these
 retirement programs without giving effect to any modification or
 termination of benefits that may ultimately be implemented based
 upon the outcome of this proceeding.

DOJ Antitrust Civil Investigative Demand. In June 2015,
 American received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the
 United States Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of an
 investigation into whether there have been illegal agreements or
 coordination of air passenger capacity. The CID seeks documents and
 other information from American, and other airlines have announced
 that they have received similar requests. American is cooperating
 fully with the DOJ investigation. In addition, subsequent to
 announcement of the delivery of CIDs by the DOJ, American, along
 with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United
 Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air
 Canada, have been named as defendants in approximately 100 putative
 class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to
 air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits have been consolidated in
 the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. On
 October 28, 2016, the Court denied a motion by the airline
 defendants to dismiss all claims in the class actions. Both the DOJ
 investigation and these lawsuits are in their relatively early
 stages and American intends to defend these matters vigorously.

Private Party Antitrust Action. On July 2, 2013, a
 lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. US Airways Group, Inc.,
 et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the
 Northern District of California. The complaint named as defendants
 US Airways Group and US Airways, alleged that the effect of the
 Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7
 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or
 divestiture. On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their complaint in the
 Bankruptcy Court, adding AMR and American as defendants. On
 November 27, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied
 plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On
 August 19, 2015, after three previous largely unsuccessful
 attempts to amend their complaint, plaintiffs filed a fourth motion
 for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint to add a
 claim for damages and demand for jury trial, as well as claims
 similar to those in the putative class action lawsuits regarding
 air passenger capacity. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a request with
 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate the
 Fjord matter with the putative class action lawsuits, which was
 denied on October 15, 2015. A scheduling order setting
 deadlines for fact and expert discovery and the parties’
 summary judgment briefing (if any) was entered by the court on
 February 22, 2017. American believes this lawsuit is without
 merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.

  

DOJ Investigation Related to the United States Postal
 Service. In April 2015, the DOJ informed American of an inquiry
 regarding American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the United
 States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail
 by air. In October 2015, American received a CID from the DOJ
 seeking certain information relating to these contracts and the DOJ
 has also sought information concerning certain of the airlines that
 transport mail on a codeshare basis. The DOJ has indicated it is

 its investigation.

 other legal proceedings from time to time. Legal proceedings
 can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach
 resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of
 variables, some of which are not within American’s control.
 Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each
 of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings,
 their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts
 on American are uncertain but could be material. See Part II, Item
 1A. Risk Factors – “We may be a party to litigation
 in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect
 our financial position and liquidity” for additional
 discussion.

Basis of Presentation


 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
 statements of American Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar
 terms, or AAG) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
 financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form
 10-K for the year ended
 December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited condensed
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AAG and
 its wholly-owned subsidiaries. AAG’s principal subsidiary is
 American Airlines, Inc. (American). All significant intercompany
 transactions have been eliminated.

 On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR)
 merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a
 Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary
 of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing
 of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name
 to American Airlines Group Inc. On December 30, 2015, in order
 to simplify AAG’s internal corporate structure, US Airways,
 Inc. (US Airways), a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Airways Group,
 merged with and into American, with American as the surviving
 corporation.

 Management believes that all adjustments necessary for the fair
 presentation of results, consisting of normally recurring items,
 have been included in the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements for the interim periods presented. The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and
 expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
 differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment
 relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill,
 impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty
 program, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as
 pensions and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
 the current year presentation.




Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
 Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
 with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by
 the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
 improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition
 guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
 (IFRS). Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs
 to clarify the implementation. The new revenue standard applies to
 all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer
 goods or services and is effective for public entities for interim
 and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
 2017. We will adopt the new revenue standard effective
 January 1, 2018. Entities have the choice to apply the new
 revenue standard either retrospectively to each reporting period
 presented or by recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the
 new revenue standard at the date of initial application and not
 adjusting comparative information. We currently expect to adopt the
 new revenue standard using the full retrospective method.

 We are still in the process of evaluating how the adoption of the
 new revenue standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. We currently expect that the new revenue
 standard will materially impact our liability for outstanding
 mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members when
 flying on American. We currently use the incremental cost method to
 account for this portion of our loyalty program liability, which
 values these mileage credits based on the estimated incremental
 cost of carrying one additional passenger. The new revenue standard
 will require us to change our policy and apply a relative selling
 price approach whereby a portion of each passenger ticket sale
 attributable to mileage credits earned will be deferred and
 recognized in passenger revenue upon future mileage redemption. The
 carrying value of the earned mileage credits recognized in loyalty
 program liability is expected to be materially greater under the
 relative selling price approach than the value attributed to these
 mileage credits under the incremental cost method. The new revenue
 standard will also require us to reclassify certain ancillary fees
 to passenger revenue, which are currently included within other
 operating revenue.

Leases

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
 842).” ASU 2016-02
 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the
 balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the
 new lessor model with those in Accounting Standards Codification
 Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
 within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities
 are required to adopt the new lease standard using a modified
 retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing
 after the date of initial application with an option to use certain
 practical expedients. We are currently evaluating how the adoption
 of the new lease standard will impact our condensed consolidated
 financial statements. Interpretations are on-going and could have a material
 impact on our implementation. Currently, we expect that the
 adoption of the new lease standard will have a material impact on
 our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of
 right-of-use assets and lease
 liabilities principally for certain leases currently accounted for
 as operating leases.

Statement of Cash Flows

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash
 Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.” ASU 2016-18 requires that the change in
 total cash, cash at beginning of period and cash at end of period
 on the statement of cash flows include restricted cash and
 restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 also requires companies who
 report cash and restricted cash separately on the balance sheet to
 reconcile those amounts to the statement of cash flows. This
 standard is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented
 and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
 after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
 fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This standard is not
 expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated
 financial statements.

Retirement Benefits

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation –
 Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net
 Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit
 Cost.” ASU 2017-07
 requires an entity to present the service cost component of net
 benefit cost in the income statement line items where it reports
 compensation cost. Entities will present all other components of
 net benefit cost outside of operating income, if this subtotal is
 presented. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to each
 period presented and is effective for public entities for fiscal
 years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years. We will adopt this standard on
 January 1, 2018. The new standard will require all components
 of our net periodic benefit cost (income), with the exception of
 service cost, currently reported within operating expenses as
 salaries, wages and benefits, to be reclassified and reported
 within nonoperating income (expense). The adoption of this new
 standard will have no impact on pre-tax income or net income reported.
 See Note 8 for our current components of net periodic benefit cost
 (income).
