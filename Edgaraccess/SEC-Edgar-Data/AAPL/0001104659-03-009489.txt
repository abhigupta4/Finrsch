APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs,
manufactures, and markets personal computers and related personal computing and
communicating solutions for sale primarily to education, creative, consumer,
and business customers.
 
Basis of Presentation
and Preparation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Interim
information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Companys management,
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of
interim periods presented have been included. 
The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results to be expected for the entire year.
 
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September
28, 2002, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
September 28, 2002 (the 2002 Form 10-K).
 
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs.  The standard applies
to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that
result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the
assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. 
The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the
life of the asset. All of the Companys existing asset retirement obligations
are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases
to original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of
September 29, 2002, gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be
required to fulfill these obligations.
 
As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term
asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold
improvements. This amount represents the present value of expected future cash
flows associated with returning certain of the Companys leased properties to
original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow
of $9.5 million and its present value at September 29, 2002, of $6 million will
be accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense.  Net of the related income tax effect of
approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable
cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of
2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative
depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of
adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Companys
existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.
 
The following table
reconciles changes in the Companys asset retirement liability for the first
six months of 2003 (in millions):

Accounting for Restructuring Charges
In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain
Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability
for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred, as opposed to when management is committed to an exit
plan.  SFAS No. 146 also establishes
that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value.
This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied
prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company measures
compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and has provided pro forma
disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair
value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The
Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB No. 25, when the exercise price
of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
As required under SFAS
No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and
earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock
purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning
of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options vesting
period and the shares plan period.
 
The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of freely
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected life of options and the Companys expected
stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly
different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of
the fair value of the Companys employee stock options and employee stock
purchase plan shares.
 
For purposes of the pro
forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the expected volatility
assumptions used by the Company have been based solely on historical volatility
rates of the Companys common stock. The Company has made no adjustments to its
expected volatility assumptions based on current market conditions, current market
trends, or expected volatility implicit in market traded options on the
Companys stock. The Company will continue to monitor the propriety of this
approach to developing its expected volatility assumption and could determine
for future periods that adjustments to historical volatility and/or use of a
methodology that is based on the expected volatility implicit in market traded
options on the Companys common stock are more appropriate based on the facts
and circumstances existing in future periods.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options
vesting period and the shares plan period. The Companys pro forma information

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of investments
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt
securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of
which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized gains on
its investment portfolio of $20 million as of September 28, 2002, and net
unrealized losses of $1 million as of March 29, 2003. The Company occasionally
sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of
such sales, the Company recognized gains of $9 million during the second quarter
of 2003 and $18 million and $3 million during the first six months of 2003 and
2002, respectively. These gains were included in interest and other income,
net.

As of March 29, 2003, and
September 28, 2002, $385 million and $1.087 billion, respectively, of the
Companys investment portfolio that was classified as short-term investments
had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. 
The remainder of the Company's short-term investments had underlying
maturities of between 3 and 12 months.
 
Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains
The Company has held
significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc.
(EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets within other assets and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments
have been included in interest and other income.  The combined fair value of these investments held by the Company
was $28 million and $39 million as of March 29, 2003, and September 28, 2002,
respectively.
 
During the first quarter
of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds
of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Companys
carrying value of the shares. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company
sold 4.7 million shares of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before
taxes of $21 million. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company also sold
250,000 shares of Akamai and 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds
of approximately $2 million each and a gain before taxes of $710,000 and
$223,000, respectively.  No sales of the
Companys non-current debt and equity investments were made in the second
quarter of 2003.
 
Debt
The Company currently has
debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount
6.5% unsecured notes that was originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay
interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to
maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $10 million of related
unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February
of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of March 29,
2003.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses
derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and
interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to
offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and
to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain
forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters
into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of
certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting policies for these
instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or
non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet
at fair value.  As of the end of the
second quarter of 2003, the general nature of the Companys risk management
activities and the general nature and mix of the Companys derivative financial
instruments have not changed materially from the end of fiscal 2002.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into
foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain
probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign
exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost
of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging
instruments.
 
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company sometimes
enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate
swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and
short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term
debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from
fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into
interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest
rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such
financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires that
all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives
that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As
of March 29, 2003, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash
flow hedges of approximately $700,000 net of taxes, substantially all of which
is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003.

Inventory Prepayment
In April 2002, the
Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of
components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the
supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components
during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 28, 2002.
Approximately $53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28,
2002 and was reflected in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003,
the remainder of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of
components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest
component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income
during each period the deposit was outstanding at an appropriate market
interest rate to reflect the economics of this transaction.
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company is currently
amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods
ranging from 3 to 7 years. The Company ceased amortization of goodwill at the
beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Accrued Warranty and Related Costs
The Company offers a
basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic
warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of
purchase by the end user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty
for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware
products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be
incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue
is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for
product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products
subject to warranty protection, historical warranty claim rates, historical
cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of
the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future expectations.

Note 4  Restructuring Actions
 
Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions
 
Q203 Restructuring Actions
During the second quarter
of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million.
The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on
further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the
Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions
associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating
segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of severance costs
of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 79 of who were terminated
prior to the end of the second quarter at a cost of $1.6 million. During the
second quarter, an additional $400,000 was accrued for asset write-offs and
lease payments on an abandoned facility in the Americas operating segment. Except for certain costs associated with
operating leases on the abandoned facility, the Company currently anticipates
that substantially all of the remaining accrual will be spent by the end of the
third quarter of fiscal 2003.

Q103 Restructuring Actions
During the first quarter
of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of operations
at the Company-owned manufacturing facility in Singapore, further reductions in
headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product strategy that took
place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various sales and marketing
activities in the United States and Europe. These restructuring actions will
ultimately result in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide, 197 of which
were eliminated by the end of the first quarter of 2003.
 
Closure of the Companys
Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million
and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed assets,
whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs included
severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of previously
deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the
Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who were
terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and marketing
activities and employees, principally in the United States and Europe, resulted
in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs associated with
operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The total net restructuring
charge of $23 million recognized during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects
the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring accrual originally made during
the first quarter of 2002.
 
During the second quarter
of 2003, the Company identified and reversed approximately $150,000 of
severance  costs accrued as part of the
first quarter 2003 restructuring actions when it was determined the accrual
would not be used. As of March 29, 2003, approximately $4 million of the
original $5 million accrual for severance had been utilized and a total of 242
positions had been eliminated. Except for certain costs associated with
operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently anticipates that
substantially all of the remaining accrual for severance will be spent to
eliminate 14 additional positions by the end of the third quarter of fiscal
2003.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Actions
During fiscal 2002, the
Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30 million
related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align
the Companys operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and
to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product
development and investments in the Companys Retail operating segment.
 
Q402 Restructuring Actions
During the fourth quarter
of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce headcount
costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product
strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of
approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, 162 of which
were eliminated by December 28, 2002. Eliminated positions were primarily in
corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development
in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool
included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchools PSE product.
This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development
costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. As of
March 29, 2003, substantially all of the $2 million severance accrual had been
utilized, except for insignificant severance and related costs associated with
12 remaining positions.

Q102 Restructuring Actions
During the first quarter
of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions
resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost
of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Companys operations,
information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these
restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Companys
information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and
cancellation of existing projects and activities.  The Company ceased using the assets associated with first quarter
2002 restructuring actions during that same quarter. Related lease and contract
cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments
totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily
related to corporate activity not allocated to operating segments. During the
first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of
$600,000.

Note 5  Shareholders Equity
 
CEO Restricted
Stock Award
On March 19, 2003, the
Company entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award
Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief Executive
Officer.  The Agreement cancelled stock
option awards previously granted to Mr. Jobs 
in 2000 and 2001 for the purchase of 27.5 million common shares of the
Companys common stock.  Mr. Jobs
retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Companys common stock
granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Companys Board of
Directors.  The Agreement replaced the
cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the
Companys common stock.  The restricted
stock award generally vests three years from date of grant.  Vesting of some or all of the restricted
shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause,
dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in control of the
Company.
 
The Company has recorded
the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a component of
shareholders equity and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis
over the 3-year service/vesting period. 
The value of the restricted stock award was based on the closing market
price of the Companys common stock on the date of the award.  Quarterly amortization will be approximately
$6.3 million and will be recognized as an operating expense.  The 5 million restricted shares will be
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. 
This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
Since inception of the stock repurchase plan through the end of fiscal 2000,
the Company had repurchased a total of 5.05 million shares at a cost of $191
million. No shares have been repurchased since the end of fiscal 2000. During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase
agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of
2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5
million.  The total cost to acquire the
same number of shares at the closing price of the Company's common stock on
March 29, 2003, would be approximately $22.3 million.
 
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income
consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments
from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and from net deferred gains and losses on certain
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 6  Employee Benefit Plans
 
1998 Executive
Officer Stock Plan
The 1998 Executive
Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan) is a shareholder approved plan which
replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock
Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term
Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these
plans termination dates remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, executive officers of the Company at the level of Senior Vice
President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and
generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the
granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock
appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.
 
1997 Employee
Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the
1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant
date.
 
1997 Director
Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock
Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of
30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the
first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual
grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.
 
Employee Stock
Purchase Plan
The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases
under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to
a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. 
As of March 29, 2003, approximately 1 million shares were reserved for
issuance under the Purchase Plan.
 
15







 
Subsequent Event  Employee Stock Plans
At the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an amendment to
the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the plan to the
2003 Employee Stock Option Plan, to provide for broad-based grants to all
employees in addition to executive officers and other key employees and to
prohibit repricings including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs
without shareholder approval.  Since the
amendment was approved, the Company will terminate the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan and cancel all remaining unissued shares, following the completion
of the employee stock option exchange program. 
In addition, shareholders also approved an amendment to the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by
4 million shares.

Employee Stock Option Exchange Program
On March 20, 2003, the
Company announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the
Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors, have an opportunity to exchange outstanding
options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share, for a predetermined
smaller number of new stock options that will be granted at the fair market
value on the day of the new grant, which will be at least six months plus one
day after the exchange options are cancelled. 
On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company
accepted and cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common
stock and issued a promise to grant approximately 6,892,309 new options to
participating employees. Options cancelled pursuant to the Exchange Program are
reflected as outstanding as of March 29, 2003, in the preceding tables. The new
stock options will be granted on October 20, 2003, which is the first business
day that is six months and one day after cancellation of the exchanged options.
No financial or accounting impact to the Companys financial position, results
of operations or cash flow for the three months ended March 29, 2003, was
associated with this transaction.
 
Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has provided
pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair
value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for its
employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases. These
pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the
period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
The assumptions used for
the three and six-month periods ended March 29, 2003, and March 30, 2002, and
the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as follows:

Note 8  Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The Company leases
various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for
terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to
5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 12 years and
often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 28, 2002, the
Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases were $464 million, of which $209 million related to leases for retail
space.  As of March 29, 2003, total
future minimum lease payments related to leases for retail space increased to
$305 million.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September
27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially
identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the
Companys publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28,
2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and
seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes
these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The
Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court
on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Companys
motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to
plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint
on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the amended complaint. A hearing on the Companys motion is currently
scheduled for July 2003.
 
The Company is subject to
certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected.
 
The parliament of the European
Union has finalized the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
(the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including
personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and
safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved
and implemented by individual European Union governments by August 13, 2004,
while the producers financial obligations are scheduled to start August 13,
2005. The Companys potential liability resulting from the Directive related to
past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its
product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws,
regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between
individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the
Companys existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive.
As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific
requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will
continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be
enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the
United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.
 
Note 9 - Segment Information and Geographic Data
 
The Company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the
Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as
well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. The
Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Other
operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia
except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable
geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products
and similar services, and the
 
18







 
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except
as described below for the Retail segment.
 
The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segments
performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating
income for each segment includes revenue from third parties, cost of sales, and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for
each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are
managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating
income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in
standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses
include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other
separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain
corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets
include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to
depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital
expenditures by the Retail segment were $30 million and $24 million during the
first six months of 2003 and during the second quarter of 2003, respectively.
 
Operating income for all
segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.
 
To assess the operating
performance of the Retail segment several significant items are included in its
results for internal management reporting that are not included in results of
the Companys other segments. First, cost of sales for the Retail segment includes
a mark-up above the Companys standard cost to approximate the price normally
charged to the Companys resellers operating retail stores in the United
States. For the second quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002, this
resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by
the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of
approximately $23 million and $21 million, respectively. For the first six
months of 2003 and the first six months of 2002, this resulted in the
recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail
segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $46
million and $30 million, respectively.
 
Second, the Retail
segment includes in its net sales proceeds from sales of the Companys extended
warranty and support contracts and also recognizes related cost of sales based
on the amount such contracts are normally sold to the Companys resellers
operating retail stores in the United States. This treatment is consistent with
how the Companys major resellers account for the sales and cost of the
Companys extended warranty and support contracts. Because the Company has not
yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these
contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in the Americas segments
net sales and cost of sales. For the second quarter of 2003, this resulted in
the recognition of additional net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $6.3 million
and $4.3 million, respectively. For the second quarter of 2002, the net sales
and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended
warranty and support contracts were $1.9 million and $1.4 million,
respectively. For the first six months of 2003, this resulted in the
recognition of additional net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment,
with corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $12.2 million and $8.5
million, respectively. This compares to similar adjustments to net sales and
cost of sales during the first six months of 2002 of $3.0 million and $2.1
million, respectively.
 
Third, a portion of the
operating expenses associated with certain high profile retail stores is allocated
from the Retail segment to corporate marketing expense. Allocation of these
expenses reflects the unique nature of these stores which, given their larger
size and extraordinary design elements, function as vehicles for general
corporate marketing, corporate sales and marketing events, and brand
awareness.  Allocated operating costs
are those in excess of operating costs incurred by one of the Companys more
typical retail locations. Stores were open in two such high profile locations
in New York and Los Angeles as of March 29, 2003, both of which were opened in
fiscal 2002. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the
operations of these two stores were $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2003
and $2.2 million for the six-months ended March 29, 2003. These costs were not
significant during the first half of 2002.

Note 10 - Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per common
share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect
of outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected in diluted earnings
per share by application of the treasury stock method.

Options to purchase
approximately 74 and 44 million shares of common stock that were outstanding at
March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively, were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for the quarters then ended because
the options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
Companys common stock during those quarters and therefore, their effect would
have been antidilutive. Additionally, 5 million shares of restricted stock were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the second
quarter of 2003 because their effect would have been antidilutive.
 
Note 11  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other
Transactions
 
In March 2002, the
Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive
Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr.
Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business.  The Reimbursement Agreement is effective for
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took
delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $77,000 in
expenses pursuant to this reimbursement agreement during the second quarter of
2003, and $161,000 in expenses for the six-months ended March 29, 2003. For
fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a total of $1,168,000 in expenses pursuant
to this reimbursement agreement related to expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs during
2001 and 2002.
 
Mr. Jerome York, a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment
group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in
January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion dollar specialty
catalogue and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products,
including products made by the Company, through its MacWarehouse
catalogue.  MicroWarehouse accounted for
2.8% and 3.0% of the Companys net sales for the three and six-month periods
ended March 29, 2003, respectively, and 3.3% of the Companys net sales in
fiscal 2002. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $20.2 million and $20.9
million as of March 29, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively. Sales to
MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables are generally subject to the same
terms and conditions as those with the Companys other resellers. In addition,
the Company purchases miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse.
Total purchases amounted to approximately $385,000 and $1.2 million for the
three and six-month periods ended March 29, 2003, respectively, and $2.9
million in fiscal 2002.

Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Companys
actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include,
but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled Factors
That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition below. The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2002 Form 10-K and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. All information is based on the Companys fiscal
calendar.
 
Available Information
Beginning in fiscal 2003,
the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to
Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
are available on our website at www.apple.com/investor when such reports are
available on the Securities and Exchange Commission website. The contents of
this website are not incorporated into this filing.  Further, our reference to the URL for this website is intended to

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations requires the Companys management
to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported
in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys 2002 Form 10-K
describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the
preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Management believes the
Companys critical accounting policies are those related to revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase
commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles, and
valuation of non-current debt and equity investments. Management believes these
policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal
of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require management
to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Additional
information about these critical accounting policies may by found in the
Companys 2002 Form 10-K in Item 7,
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, under the heading Critical Accounting Policies.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently
measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro
forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The
Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed in Note 1 of the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provided in this Form
10-Q, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the
exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
The Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) decided on April 22, 2003, to require all companies to
expense the value of employee stock options. Companies will be required to
measure the cost of employee stock options according to their fair value. The
FASB has indicated that later this year it plans to issue an exposure draft of
a new accounting standard addressing this matter. This new accounting
standard  could become effective as
early as 2004. Prior to issuance of this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated
it will be addressing several significant technical issues. Among other things,
the FASB must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will
permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and
actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the amount of
compensation cost recognized. Also, a method to determine the fair value of
employee stock options must be established. Current accounting standards
require use of an option-pricing model,
 
22







 
such as the Black-Scholes model, to determine fair value and provide
guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model. This
valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to
changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of
employee stock options under the new standard.
 
The Company has provided
formal input to both the FASB and the International Accounting Standards
Board  (IASB) regarding the IASBs
exposure draft on stock-based compensation and the FASBs efforts to achieve
maximum convergence on accounting for stock-based compensation between U.S. and
international accounting standards. The Company believes it is important to be
involved in the development of accounting standards and plans on continuing its
involvement in the process of developing new U.S. and international accounting
standards regarding the accounting for employee stock options.
 
At the Companys annual
shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal
requesting that the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy
of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the
Company. The Board and management appreciates and takes seriously the views
expressed by the Companys shareholders. However, in light of the FASBs
announced intention to soon require all companies to expense the value of
employee stock options and the FASBs near-term review of technical issues that
will play a significant role in determining the value of and accounting for
employee stock options, the Company does not currently intend to expense the
value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting
standard on the matter.

Business Outlook
For
the third quarter of 2003, the Company expects net sales, gross margin, and
total operating expenses to be relatively flat as compared to the second
quarter of 2003. The Company expects third quarter interest and other
income, net to decline significantly to approximately $15 million. As a result,
the Company currently expects to report a slight profit for the third quarter
of 2003.
 
The
foregoing statements concerning the Companys anticipated net sales, gross
margin, operating expenses, interest and other income, net, and earnings for the third quarter of 2003 are
forward-looking. The Companys actual results could differ. The Companys
future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon general
economic conditions, market conditions within the PC industry, and the Companys
ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically
innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly
competitive market for personal computers. Some of the potential risks and
uncertainties that could affect the Companys future operating results and
financial condition are discussed throughout this Item 2, including the
discussion under the heading below Factors That May Affect Future Results and
Financial Condition, and in the 2002 Form 10-K.

Notes:
(a)             Other Segments
consists of Asia Pacific and FileMaker. Certain net sales in 2002 fiscal
periods related to recent acquisitions and Internet services have been
reclassified from Other Segments net sales to Americas segment net sales to
conform to the 2003 presentation.
(b)            Power Macintosh
figures include server sales.
(c)             Net sales of
peripherals and other hardware include sales of iPod, Apple-branded and
third-party displays, and other hardware accessories.
(d)            Net sales of software
include sale of Apple-branded operating system and application software and
sale of third-party software.
(e)             Net sales per
Macintosh unit sold are derived by dividing total Macintosh net sales by total
Macintosh unit sales.
 
Net sales during the second quarter of 2003 fell
1% from the same period in 2002, but were up 3% for the first six months of
fiscal 2003 compared to 2002. Several factors have contributed favorably to net
sales during both the first half and the second quarter of 2003 including:
 
26







 
                     Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose $63 million or 41% during
the second quarter of 2003 compared to the same quarter in 2002 and rose $101
million or 30% for the first six months of 2003. These increases are the result
of significant year-over-year increases in iPod sales and in sales of computer
accessories, including Apple-branded displays.
 
                     Net sales of
software rose $23 million or 32% during the second quarter of 2003 compared to
the same quarter in 2002 and rose $48 million
or 36% for the first six months of 2003. These increases reflect higher net
sales of Apple-branded application software, Mac OS X software, and third-party
software. Net sales of Apple-branded software during the first six months of
2003 has been favorably affected by several new software titles, including
Final Cut Express, iLife, Keynote, and Shake.
 
                     The Retail
segments net sales grew to $283 million during the first six months of 2003
from $118 million during the same period in 2002, a 140% increase. The Retail
segments 2003 second quarter net sales rose $65 million or 93% from the second
quarter of 2002. While the Retail segment may divert some net sales from the
Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company believes that a
substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the
Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail
segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
                     Although total
Macintosh unit sales are down in fiscal 2003, PowerBook sales have been strong.
PowerBook net sales were up 78% during the second quarter of 2003 and up 29%
during the first six months of 2003. New PowerBook models introduced during the
first six months of 2003 included two new form factors and the Companys first
portable product capable of burning DVDs.
 
                     Net sales per
Macintosh unit sold were up 4% for the second quarter of 2003 and up 3% for the
first six months of 2003. These increases reflect the higher proportion of
relatively higher value PowerBook models and a shift in mix towards higher
value iMac models, including the flat panel models introduced during 2002.
 
Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net
sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2003 were negatively
impacted by three notable factors.
 
                     Unit
sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 26% during both the second quarter and
first six months of 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002. These declines
are consistent with the declining sales of Power Macintosh systems experienced
by the Company during recent years. The Company continues to believe that weak
economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of
these customers continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due
to the Companys ongoing transition to Mac OS X, customer perception of
microprocessor clock speed on overall system performance, and in anticipation
of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented
Macintosh software applications, such as QuarkXPress, to run natively in Mac OS
X. However, the Company did not experience the anticipated increase in Power
Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of Adobes
PhotoShop 7 during 2002.
 
                     The
Company experienced weakness in its U.S. education channel during the second
quarter of 2003. While 2003 first quarter net sales in this channel were relatively
flat compared to 2002, second quarter net sales in 2003 in U.S. education fell
8% as compared to 2002, while Macintosh unit sales fell 14%. The Company
believes this weakness has been caused by multiple factors including funding
pressures due to weak economic conditions and large budget deficits in many
states and due to increased competition. Although the Company has taken steps,
and will continue to take steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education
channel, it is difficult to anticipate how this trend will affect the remainder
of 2003 and thereafter or to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse.
 
27







 
                     The
personal computer industry in general, and the Company specifically, continues
to see relatively soft demand for its products. Sales of professional and
consumer oriented Macintosh systems remain far below levels experienced in
fiscal 2000 and earlier. Worsening global economic conditions over the past
three years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by
terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly
had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Companys
products in virtually all of its markets. Further, growth in the overall
personal computer industry has slowed due to the high market penetration of
personal computers and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business
personal computer upgrade cycles. In summary, the Company believes that
expansion in the overall market for personal computers has slowed and that
significant growth continues to await a combination of economic recovery and
technological advancements.
 
Segment
Operating Performance
The Company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the
Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as
well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan.  The Retail segment operates Apple-owned
retail stores in the United States. Each reportable geographic operating
segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services.
Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales
in the Americas segment during the second quarter of 2003 decreased  $52 million or 7% compared to the same
quarter in 2002, and declined $17 million or 1% for the first six months of
2003 compared to the same period in 2002. Both the quarterly and year-to-date
results of the Americas segment are similar to the overall results of the
Company as they reflect lower unit sales and net sales of Power Macintosh
systems and iMac systems partially offset by significant increases in unit
sales and net sales of PowerBooks and by net sales of peripherals and software.
The Americas segment results were also negatively affected by the 8% decline in
quarterly net sales in the U.S. education channel. As discussed above, the
Company believes the cause for this decline is that U.S. educational
institutions appear to have reduced or postponed capital spending due to
federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from
the weak economy and that competition in this market is increasing. Additionally,
some of the decline in 2003 net sales in the Americas segment may be the result
of the operation of the Companys Retail segment whose net sales, all of which
occur within the U.S., increased significantly in the first half of 2003.
 
Europe
Net
sales in Europe decreased $27 million or 7% during the second quarter of 2003
as compared to the same quarter in 2002, and decreased $39 million or 5% during
the first six months of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002.  Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe for the
three and six-month periods ended March 29, 2003, were down 15% and 10%,
respectively. Europe has experienced weakened demand for Power Macintosh and
iMac systems in 2003 and strong demand for PowerBooks, peripherals, and
software. Demand for professionally oriented Macintosh systems was particularly
weak in Europe in the first quarter of 2003 compared to the same period in
2002.
 
Japan
Net sales in the Japan
segment during the second quarter of 2003 decreased $7 million or 3% compared
to the same quarter in 2002, and decreased $51 million or 12% during the first
six months of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002. Although Japan did experience a sequential increase in net
sales and unit sales in the second quarter of 2003 from the first quarter of
58% and 51%, respectively, Japans Macintosh unit sales remain significantly
below the segments historic levels due to current economic conditions that
remain particularly negative in Japan. Consistent with other geographic
operating segments, Japan experienced strong demand for PowerBooks during the
second quarter of 2003.
 
28







 
Retail
The
Company opened two new retail stores early in the second quarter of 2003,
bringing the total number of open stores to 53 as of the end of the second
quarter of 2003. This compares to 29 stores as of the end of the same quarter
in 2002. The Retail segments net sales grew to $283 million during the
first six months of 2003 from $118 million during the same period in 2002, a
140% increase. Second quarter net sales in 2003 grew 93% from the same quarter
in 2002. Activities of the Retail segment
have contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of computer peripherals
and software experienced by the Company during 2003. During the first half of
2003, approximately 42% of the Retail segments net sales came from the sale of
Apple-branded and third-party peripherals and software. This compares to 25%
for the Company as a whole.
 
As
measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment lost
$4 million during the first six months of 2003 compared to $12 million during
the same period in 2002. This improvement is primarily attributable the
segments year-over-year increase in net sales.
 
Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial
investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease
commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures
associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $198 million
through the end of fiscal 2002, and totaled $30 million during the first six
months of 2003. As of March 29, 2003, the Retail segment had approximately
1,000 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with
retail store space and related facilities of $305 million. The Company would
incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or
close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys
results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a new business model such as the Retail segment is
inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved,
the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the
Retail segments operating expenses. Results for this segment are
dependent upon a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed
below under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial
Condition.

Gross margin for the
first six months of 2003 was 28% compared to 29% for the same period in 2002.
The year-over-year decline in gross margin during the first six months of 2003
reflects relatively aggressive pricing beginning in late fiscal 2002 on several
Macintosh models and lower sales of relatively higher margin Power Macintosh
systems partially offset by a higher mix of higher margin portable products,
peripherals, and software.
 
As noted above, the
Company currently expects gross margin as a percent of net sales to be
relatively flat in the third quarter of 2003 as compared to the second quarter.
However, the Companys gross margin and the gross margin of the personal
computer industry is expected to remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003
in light of weak economic conditions, flat demand for personal computers in general,
price competition in the PC industry, and potential increases in component
pricing.
 
The foregoing statements
regarding the Companys expected gross margin during the third quarter of 2003,
general demand for personal computers, anticipated industry component pricing,
and future economic conditions are forward-looking. Gross margin could differ
from anticipated levels because of several factors, including certain of those
set forth below in the subsection entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results
and Financial Condition. There can be no assurance that current gross margins
will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current
margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross
margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry
wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life
cycles,
 
29







 
potential increases in
the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services,
and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales
of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins.
In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue
to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also
be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and
warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The
Companys operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes
in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Companys results of
operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in
exchange rates.
 
The Company orders
components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product
shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast
incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient
inventories of particular products or components. The Companys operating
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be
materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its inventory
levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term
shifts in customer demand patterns.

Research and Development (R&D)
Expenditures for research
and development increased 7% for both the three and six month periods ending in
March of 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002 primarily due to increased
R&D headcount to support expanded R&D activities. The Company has
continued to expand R&D even though its net sales and profitability are
under pressure. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain
competitive. The Companys management believes that maintaining or increasing
the pace of innovation and product development is the best way to respond to
current economic and market conditions and will better position the Company for
future growth when conditions improve.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)
SG&A increased 11%
and 7% during the second quarter of 2003 and for the first six months of fiscal
2003, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2002. Increased SG&A
is primarily the result of increased selling expenses associated with the
expanded operations of the Companys Retail segment partially offset by a
decline in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising.
 
Restructuring Costs
During the second quarter
of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8 million.
The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part
supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on
further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the
Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further reductions
associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating
segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of severance costs
of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 79 of who were terminated
prior to the end of the second quarter at a cost of $1.6 million. During the
second quarter, an additional $400,000 was accrued for asset write-offs and
lease payments on an abandoned facility in the Americas operating segment. Once
fully implemented, the Company estimates these restructuring actions will
reduce quarterly operating expenses by $1.5 million.
 
During the first quarter
of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of operations
at the Company-owned manufacturing facility in
 
30







 
Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in
PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and
Europe. These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination
of 260 positions worldwide, 242 of which were eliminated by the end of the
second quarter of 2003. Once fully implemented, the Company estimates these
restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of $6
million.
 
During the first quarter
of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of approximately $24 million. These restructuring actions
resulted in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide at a cost
of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company operations,
information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these
restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Companys
information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and
cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract
cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments
totaled $4 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company reversed the
remaining unused accrual of $600,000. The first quarter 2002 restructuring
actions were primarily related to corporate activity not allocated to operating
segments and have eliminated approximately $8.5 million of quarterly operating
expenses.

Gains and Losses on Non-current
Investments
During the first quarter
of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink) stock
for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated
the Companys carrying value of the shares sold. During the first quarter of
2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares of ARM Holdings plc (ARM) stock for
both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. During the first
quarter of 2002, the Company also sold 250,000 shares of Akamai Technologies,
Inc. (Akamai) and 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of
approximately $2 million each and a gain before taxes of $710,000 and $223,000,
respectively.
 
Interest and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other
income, net decreased $4 million or 15% to $23 million during the second
quarter of 2003 compared to the same quarter in 2002 and decreased $9 million
or 15% for the first six months of 2003 from the same period in 2002. These
decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the
Companys cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market interest
rates and the closing out of longer-term investments in favor of investments
with shorter maturities. Declines in investment yields were partially offset by
gains on the sale of short-term investments. The Company occasionally sells
short-term investments prior to their stated maturities.  As a result of such sales, the Company
recognized net gains of $9 million during the second quarter of 2003 and $18
million and $3 million during the first 6 months of fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The sale of short-term investments during the first half of 2003
was intended to shorten the average maturity of the Companys investment
portfolio based on managements belief that interest rates are at or near their
bottom.
 
Interest expense consists
primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal
amount unsecured notes partially offset by amortization of deferred gains
realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated
with the unsecured notes. The unsecured notes, which mature in February of
2004, were
 
31







 
sold at 99.925% of par
for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from
the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million, $10 million of which
remained unamortized as of March 29, 2003, is being amortized over the
remaining life of the unsecured notes at a rate of approximately $2.8 million
per quarter.
 
As noted above, the
Company currently expects interest and other income, net to decline
significantly during the third quarter of 2003 to approximately $15 million as the impact of declining interest rates and the
repositioning of the Companys cash portfolio to shorter-term maturities impact
earnings on the Companys investment portfolio. The Company believes further
declines in interest and other income, net following the third quarter of fiscal 2003 are likely. The
foregoing statements are forward-looking. Interest and other income, net, in
the third quarter of 2003 and in subsequent periods and the average maturity of
the Companys investment portfolio could differ from expected levels because of
several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection
entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. Additionally, actual future interest and other
income, net could be significantly impacted by unforeseen changes in market
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, by sales of short-term
investments, and by future changes in the fair value of the Companys
short-term and long-term investments.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
The Companys effective
tax rate for the three and six-month periods ended March 29, 2003 was
approximately 28%. The Companys 2003 effective rate differs from the statutory
federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign
earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings will
be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and due to the research and
development credit.
 
The Company currently
believes that its effective tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2003 will be
approximately 28%. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Companys
future tax rate could differ because of several factors, including those set
forth below in the subsection entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results
and Financial Condition. The Companys actual future tax rate may be impacted
by the amount and jurisdiction of foreign profits or any changes to applicable
tax laws and regulations. On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
completed its audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years
1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these
adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office.  Substantially all IRS audit issues for years
prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision
has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should
any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not
consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to
adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2002,
the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to
account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF
Issue No. 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. While the Company will continue to
evaluate the requirements of EITF Issue No. 00-21, management does not
currently believe adoption will have a significant impact on its accounting for
multiple element arrangements.
 
In January 2003, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and
applies immediately to any variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after
that date.  For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to
February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the
first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. While it
will continue to evaluate the requirements of FIN 46, the Company does not
currently believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of
operations or financial position.

As
of March 29, 2003, the Company had $4.526 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $189 million over
the same balances at the end of fiscal 2002. The principal components of this
increase were cash generated by operating activities of $208 million,
proceeds of $13 million from the sale of a long-term investment, and proceeds
of $16 million from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by capital
expenditures of $60 million.
 
The Company believes its
existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures,
stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity
requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.
 
Lease Commitments
As of September 28, 2002,
the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases
of $464 million, $209 million of which related to the lease of retail space and
related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing operating leases
range from 1 to 12 years. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable
operating leases related to the lease of retail space and related facilities
rose to $305 million as of March 29, 2003.
 
Debt
The Company currently has
debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount
6.5% unsecured notes that was originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay
interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to
maturity of 6.51%. The notes, along with approximately $10 million of
unamortized deferred gains on closed interest rate swaps, are due in February
of 2004 and therefore have been classified as current debt as of March 29,
2003.
 
Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and
Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes
several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys
products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These
contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging
from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains individual components for its
products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry
practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The nature of the Companys outstanding third-party manufacturing
commitments and component purchase commitments has not changed significantly
since the end of its fiscal 2002.

Capital Expenditures
Of $60 million in total
capital expenditures during the first half of fiscal 2003, $30 million was for
retail store facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment
and $30 million was for corporate infrastructure, including information systems
enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize
approximately $150 million for capital expenditures during 2003, approximately
$75 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the
Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal
replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information
technology infrastructure.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. 
This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
Since inception of the stock repurchase plan through the end of fiscal 2000,
the Company had repurchased a total of 5.05 million shares at a cost of $191
million. No shares have been repurchased since the end of fiscal 2000. During
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase
agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of
2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million.
 
Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments
The Company has held
significant investments in ARM, Akamai, and
EarthLink. These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
as non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these
investments have been included in other income. The combined fair value of
these investments was $28 million and $39 million as of the end of the second
quarter of 2003 and the end of fiscal 2002, respectively. The Company believes
it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair
value of these investments in the future.
 
Additional
information related to the Companys non-current debt and equity investments
may be found in this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements at Note 2, Financial Instruments, and in the 2002 Form
10-K.
 
Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial
Condition
 
Because of the following
factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and
financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be
a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
 
General economic conditions and
current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the Company.
The
Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic
conditions. For much of the past 3 years, demand for the Companys products has
been negatively impacted by worsening global economic conditions. Additionally,
some of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying technology
purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on
their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions
continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should
global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to
deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could continue to be adversely
affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and
resellers.
 
The
terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, disrupted commerce
throughout the world and created many economic and political uncertainties that
have had a strong negative impact on the global economy. The long-term
effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Companys future operating
results and financial condition remain unknown. The national and international
responses to terrorist attacks, the potential for future terrorist attacks and
other acts of hostility, and the potential for further war in the Middle East
and elsewhere have created economic and political uncertainties that could
adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial
condition.
 
34







 
Expansion and/or intensification of
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  in Asia and elsewhere could negatively
affect the Companys operations and performance.
The SARS outbreak has so
far had only a minor effect on the Company. The Company has restricted nonessential
employee travel to various areas impacted by the illness and formed an internal
management committee to closely monitor the situation. The Company has
experienced weakness in net sales in specific areas affected by the illness and
has experienced some increase in freight costs as airlines have reduced service
to certain areas. To date, these conditions have not had a material adverse
impact on the Companys financial results or general operations. However,
should the illness spread to new regions in Asia or elsewhere or intensify in
severity in areas already affected, the Companys operating results could be
adversely impacted.
 
The Company and some of
its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations
in various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China,
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which have
been subject to World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention SARS travel advisories. Similar travel advisories have been issued
for Taiwan, where all of the Companys portable Macintosh systems and the iPod
are assembled. Should the illness spread further or should it intensify in
regions already affected, circumstances could arise that would negatively
impact the Company including the need for more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services
within Asia and between Asia and other regions, governmental actions limiting
the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of
new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing
vendors and component suppliers.
 
The market for personal computers is highly competitive. If
the Company is unable to effectively compete in this market, its results of
operations could be adversely affected.
The personal computer
industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing
practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new
products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product
price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers,
and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price
competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense.
The Companys competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or
maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing
products that began in the second half of calendar 2000. The Companys results
of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue
to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures
and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
The personal computer
industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in
software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or
emerging industry standards.  Further,
as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the
Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler
than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the
Companys existing products.  Several
competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to
target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer,
education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and
publishing.  Additionally, several of
the Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce
products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and
solutions of the Companys products. The Company has many substantial
competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and
technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed
customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend
towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in
larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets.
 
The Company is currently
the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market
share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of
computers utilizing Microsofts Windows operating systems. The Companys future
operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its
ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order
to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing
platforms, including Windows.
 
The Company has higher research and development and selling,
general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues, than many of its
competitors.
The Companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent
upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and
competitive products and technology to the
 
35







 
marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and
development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell
Windows-based personal computers. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively
on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the
expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing
the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs
higher selling costs as a percent of revenue than many of its competitors. If
the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products
with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially
adversely affected by its operating cost structure.
 
The Company must successfully manage frequent product
introductions and transitions.
Due to the highly
volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by
dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company
must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing
products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance,
the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the availability of application software for new products, the effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the
availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand,
and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance
the effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.
 
During 2001, the Company
introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first
major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. During 2002, the Company delivered
another major upgrade, Mac OS X Jaguar. Inability of the Company to improve the
performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the
new operating system and its upgrades, or obtain the continued commitment of
software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X or
create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the
Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
Because orders for components, and in some cases commitments
to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the
Company faces substantial inventory risk.
The Company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete
or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues
necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have
been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related
provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the
Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition,
such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.
 
The Company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast
incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient
inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice,
components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such
purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The
Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the past and
may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to
manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer
demand patterns.
 
Future operating results are dependent upon the Companys
ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short
supply or available only from limited sources.
Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and application
specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are currently obtained by the Company
from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without
limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk
drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at
times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition,
new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have
matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also
compete for various components with other industries that have experienced
increased demand for their products.
 
36







 
The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the
personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs.
Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to
decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized
to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be
delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, including rights to music
titles sold on the iTunes Music Store, the Companys results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to
produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and
desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based
microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company
with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features
that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel
Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by
personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Further, despite its
efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that
many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower
MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh
systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by Windows-based systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced
PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient
quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of
operations. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors
in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have
an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial
condition.
 
The Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics
services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the
United States.
Many of the Companys
products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In
addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics
management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of
operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and
distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on
the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the
Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although
arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty
expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to
the consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty
liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or
otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and
financial condition.
 
Final assembly of
products sold by the Company is conducted in the Companys manufacturing
facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external
vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the
Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of
many of the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of all
of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod
is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan. If for any reason manufacturing
or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic,
business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events,
the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.
 
The Companys products could experience quality problems
that result in decreased net sales and operating profits.
The Company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that may contain defects in design and
manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as
the Company sells often contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with
the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and
products the Company purchases from third parties that may be beyond its
control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and
fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could
result in lost revenues, loss of reputation, and significant expense to remedy.
 
The Companys retail initiative
requires a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties.
Since
May of 2001, the Company has opened 55 retail stores in the United States and
anticipates opening more stores during the remainder of calendar 2003. The
Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment
and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The
Company has also entered into substantial operating leases commitments for
retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 12 years. The Company would
incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close
individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of
operations and financial condition. Additionally, a
 
37







 
relatively high proportion of the Retail
segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs
and lease expense. As a result, should the Retail segment experience a decline
in sales for any reason, significant losses would result.
 
Certain
of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues
that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate
events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations
and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the
Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened two such stores
and has several others under development. Because of their location and size,
these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially
larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more
typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 5 to
10 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from
$25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high
profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks
and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its
Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which
are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail
segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those
currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail
operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among
other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general
retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction
and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Companys retail approach;
failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell
third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to
manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience
in managing retail operations; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations
in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability
to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
Unit sales of the Companys
professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over past two to
three years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin.
Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to
2001 and fell 35% in 2001 from 2000. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as
a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 38% in 1999 to 25% in 2002 and
22% during the first six months of fiscal 2003. The Company believes that weak
economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary
users of such systems. The Company also believes that many of these customers
continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the
Companys ongoing transition to Mac OS X and in anticipation of certain
software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software
applications to run natively in Mac OS X. 
Also, it is likely that many of the Company's current and potential
customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are most likely
to utilize the Company's Power Macintosh systems, believe that the relatively
slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its
Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by Windows-based
systems and translates to slower overall system performance.  In addition to the negative impact on net
sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect
on the Companys overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally
have higher individual gross margins than the Companys other Macintosh
systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales will adversely
affect the Companys future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of
Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover, it will be
difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability.
 
The Company faces increasing competition in the U.S.
education market.
Sales in the United
States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and
university customers, remains a core market for Apple. Net sales in these
markets fell to 21% of the Companys total net sales in 2002 from 26% in 2001.
The drop in 2002 reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales
in these markets of 15% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001.
Additionally, the Company experienced a 14% decline during the first six months
of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002. These developments are
consistent with industry data showing the Company losing market share in the
U.S. education market in each of the last two full fiscal years. Several
competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to
target the education market for personal computers. Although the Company has
taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its share of the
education market or maintain its existing share of that market. Failure to
increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse
impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
38







 
The Companys future operating performance is dependent on
the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys products.
The Company distributes
its products through a variety of resellers including wholesalers, national and
regional retailers and cataloguers, many of who distribute products from
competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its
products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets
directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers
through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells its own
products and certain third-party products through its retail stores in the
United States. Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on narrow
product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions.
Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit
insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel
partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers
within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products,
or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers
to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products.
 
Over the past several
years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by
the Company directly to end users through its online stores around the world
and through its retail stores in the United States. The Companys resellers may
perceive this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their
own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the
Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Companys
resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of
the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the
Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be
adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end users causes some or
all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products.
 
The Companys business is subject to the risks of
international operations.
A large portion of the
Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result,
the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly
affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on
foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are
purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated
operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign
currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact
consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of
product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
Margins on sales of Apple
products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components
obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including
tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Further information
related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part I, Item 3 of
this Form 10-Q under the subheading Foreign Currency Risk, and also in the
2002 Form 10-K.
 
The Companys future performance is dependent upon support
from third-party software developers.
The Company believes that
decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed
to Windows-based systems or other devices, are often based on the
availability of third-party software for particular applications such as
Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party
application software for the Companys hardware products depends in part on
third-party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits
of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys
products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based
on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the
anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of
Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the
Companys financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by
the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision
to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to
question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers
could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing
software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources
to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.  Moreover, there can be no assurance software
39







 
developers will continue
to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's new operating system, on a
timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and
future development by the Company of its own software applications and
solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys
products.  The company currently markets
and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals,
consumers and education customers that could influence the decision of
third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible
software products.  Software
applications currently marketed by the Company include software for
professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual
effects for large format film and video productions, professional music
production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding
and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management,
digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality
presentations.  The Company also markets
an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page
layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a
single application.  
 
In August 1997, the
Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and
technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August
2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh
computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its
Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although
Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X,
Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products
subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with
Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its
efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete
directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts
interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration
of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests
as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft
Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an
adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations.
 
The Companys business relies on access to patents and
intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Companys future
results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed
on the intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys
products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third
parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses
relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company
believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses
generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there
can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available
on acceptable terms.
 
Because of technological
changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the
Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing
patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may
be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others.
Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming,
result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and
technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation.
The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements
in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such
licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.
In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting
the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful
claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and potential
litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of the 2002 Form 10-K.  In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current
legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse
affect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the
results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should
the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of
patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I,
Item 3 of the 2002 Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Company expects its quarterly revenues and operating
results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.
The Companys profit
margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the
overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part,
on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that periods net
sales.
 
The typical concentration of net sales in the third month of
the Companys fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Companys business and
operating results.
The Company generally
sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during
either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer
industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal
infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the
Companys
 
40







 
ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late
in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products,
an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics
or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company
and its results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Companys success depends largely on its ability to
attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future
success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys employees are located. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract and retain the
key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive
performance in the Companys stock price may adversely affect its ability to
retain key employees. As of March 29, 2003, a substantial majority of the
Companys outstanding employee stock options were out-of-the-money.
 
The Company is subject to risks associated with the
availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed
rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all
areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in
higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For
some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have
insurance coverage.  For these reasons,
the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has
in the past at relatively greater cost.
 
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts
receivable. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes
its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly
to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial
majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from
certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of
raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company
has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its
trade and non-trade receivables, there can be assurance that such procedures
will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses.
Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or
continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a
material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one
or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The market value of the Companys non-current debt and
equity investments is subject to significant volatility.
The Company holds
minority investments in several public companies with a combined fair market
value of approximately $28 million as of March 29, 2003. These investments are
in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant
volatility. The Company has categorized its investments in these companies as
available-for-sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment
charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in
value that is other-than-temporary. The Company has recognized material
impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments twice
in the last two fiscal years.
 
The Company is subject to risks associated with
environmental regulations.
Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement
that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return product to the
Company at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the
Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on
the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance
that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company.
 
The parliament of the European
Union has finalized the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
(the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including
personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and
safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved
and implemented by individual European Union governments by August 13, 2004,
while the producers financial obligations are scheduled to start August 13,
2005. The Companys potential liability resulting from the Directive
 
41







 
related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with
future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely
that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary
significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently
possible to estimate the Companys existing liability or future expenses
resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member
states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the
Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact.
Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and
state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be
significant.
 
Business interruptions could adversely affect the Companys
future operating results.
The Companys major
business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power
shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical
conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys
research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other
critical business operations, including certain major components suppliers and
manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does
not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Companys
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade
disaster.
 
Unanticipated changes in the Companys tax rates could
affect its future results.
The Companys future
effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated
changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities,
or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
 
The Companys stock price may be volatile.
The Companys stock has
at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market
has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the
market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to
the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general
economic and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the
credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial
markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys
common stock in the future.
 
For a discussion of these
and other factors affecting the Companys future results and financial
condition, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis - Factors That May
Affect Future Results and Financial Condition and Item 1, Business in the
Companys 2002 Form 10-K.
 
42







 
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk
profile has not changed significantly from that described in the 2002 Form
10-K.
 
Interest
Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management
To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness
of the Companys foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as
to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company
regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its
interest rate swap and option positions both on a stand-alone basis and
in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective.
However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management
activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged,
there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a
portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in
either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the
accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market
instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may
adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as of October 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management does not believe that
ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Companys
hedging strategies.  However, its
application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other
comprehensive income.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
While the Company is
exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading
industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this
regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the
Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as
costs associated with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys fixed
income investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital,
meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit
and interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by
utilizing external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate
investment portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment
policies and also provide occasional research and market information that
supplements internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment
process.
 
During 1994, the Company
issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in
a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of
par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually
and mature on February 15, 2004.
 
The Companys exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys
investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations and related derivative
financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly
liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy
is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly
liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term
investments. As of March 29, 2003, $385 million of the Companys investment
portfolio that was classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging
from 1 to 5 years. As of September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Companys
investment portfolio that was classified as short-term investments had
maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder of such short-term
investments had underlying maturities of between 3 and 12 months. Due to
liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose
of duration management of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company may
sell investments prior to their stated maturities.  As a result of such activity, the Company recognized net gains of
$9 million and $18 million during the three and six month periods ended March
29, 2003, respectively.
 
The
Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure
away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also
 
43







 
enter into interest rate contracts that are
intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.  The Company entered into no interest rate
asset swaps during 2002 or for the first six months of 2003 and had no open
interest rate asset swaps at March 29, 2003.
 
During the last two
years, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial
institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate
interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with
its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to
diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term
U.S. interest rates. The interest rate swaps, which qualified as accounting
hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on
the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest
without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts.  These swaps effectively converted the Companys fixed-rate
10-year debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate
investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002
the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions
realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its
then existing debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the
gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are
being amortized to other income and expense over the remaining life of the
debt. At certain times in the past, the Company has also entered into interest
rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management
program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments
for purposes other than risk management.
 
Foreign Currency Risk
Overall, the Company is a
net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally
benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates,
and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the
Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is
also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing
within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when
there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The Company enters into
foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but
not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys practice is to
hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction
exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of
certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management as
of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms.
 
There were no significant
changes in the Companys internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.
There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses identified, and
therefore there were no corrective resulting actions taken. However, the design
of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events and there is no certainty that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goal under all potential future considerations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed below and/or in the
2002 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings
and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have
not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not
have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims
that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
Pitney Bowes Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff Pitney Bowes
filed this patent infringement action on June 18, 2001 alleging patent
infringement relating to laser printer technology. Plaintiff has filed similar
lawsuits against other companies. Plaintiff sought unspecified damages and
other relief.  The Company answered the
complaint, denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.
The Company settled this matter during the second quarter of 2003 for an amount
that did not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
liquidity or results of operations.
 
Hawaii Structural Iron Workers and Pension Trust Fund v.
Apple Computer, Inc. and Steven P. Jobs; Young v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al;
Hsu v. Apple Computer Inc. et al
Beginning on September
27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially
identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the
Companys publicly traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28,
2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and
seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes
these claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The
Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court
on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Companys
motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to
plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their
amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed
a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A hearing on the Companys motion is
currently scheduled for July 2003.

Exhibit
3.3
 
BY-LAWS
 
OF
 
APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
(a California
corporation)
 
(as amended through March
19, 2003)
 
Article I
 
OFFICES
 
Section 1.1:                                   Principal
Office.  The principal executive
office for the transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1
Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California 95014. 
The Board of Directors is hereby granted full power and authority to
change the location of the principal executive office from one location to
another.
 
Section 1.2:
                                Other
Offices.  One or more branch or
other subordinate offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of
Directors at such place or places within or without the State of California as it
deems appropriate.
 
Article II
 
DIRECTORS
 
Section 2.1:                                   Exercise
of Corporate Powers.  Except as
otherwise provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors.
 
Section 2.2:
                                Number.  The number of directors of the corporation
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of directors shall be six
(6) until changed within the limits specified above, by a by-law amending this
section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders. The
indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite number fixed
without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law duly adopted by the
vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed
number or the minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot
be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the
shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written
consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote.  No amendment may change the
stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two
times the stated minimum number of directors minus one.
 
Section 2.3:                                   Need
Not Be Shareholders.  The directors
of this corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.
 
Section 2.4:                                   Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any
director from serving this corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.
 
1







 
Section 2.5:                                   Election
and Term of Office. Through and until immediately prior to the annual
meeting of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, the directors shall be
divided into two classes,  designated
Class I and Class II, each consisting of one-half of the directors or  as close an approximation as possible, and
each director shall serve for a term 
running until the second annual meeting of shareholders succeeding his
or her  election and until his or her
successor shall have been duly elected and 
qualified; provided, however, that the terms of all directors shall
expire at  the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000. Commencing at the annual meeting
of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, each director shall be elected
to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal
year or until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.
 
Section 2.6:                                   Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director
is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at
that meeting.  The Board of Directors
may declare vacant the office of a director if he or she is declared of unsound
mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after
notice of his or her election, he or she does not accept the office.  Any vacancy, except for a vacancy created by
removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may be filled by a
person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.  Vacancies occurring in the Board of
Directors by reason of removal of directors shall be filled only by approval of
shareholders.  The shareholders may
elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the
directors.  Any such election by written
consent requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote.  If, after the filling of any
vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been elected by
the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the directors then in
office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more of the total number
of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors
may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held to elect the entire Board
of Directors.  The term of office of any
director shall terminate upon such election of a successor.  Any director may resign effective upon
giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of this
corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of
such resignation.  If the resignation is
effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the
resignation becomes effective.  A
reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director
prior to the expiration of such directors term of office.
 
Section
2.7:                                   Removal.
The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without
cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is
removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such
director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be
voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were
cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to
vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent
annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom
removal is being sought, were then being elected.  If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be
elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class
or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority
granted by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of
this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the
vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.
 
Section 2.8:                                   Powers
and Duties.  Without limiting the
generality or extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the
Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby
provided that the Board of Directors shall have full power with respect to the
following matters:
 
2

them security for faithful performance.
 
(k)                                  To

determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any

distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any other lawful action; and in such case only shareholders of
record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the
meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights or to
exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any

corporation, signed officially by any officer or officers thereunto duly

held at the principal executive office for the transaction of business of this
corporation, or at any place within or without the State which may be
designated by written consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,
or which may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Any meeting shall be valid wherever held if
held by the written consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,
given either before or after the meeting and filed with the Secretary of this
corporation.
 
Section 10.2:                             Annual
Meetings.  The annual meeting of the
shareholders shall be held at the hour of 10:00 a.m. on the last Wednesday in
January in each year , if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on
the next succeeding business day not a legal holiday or at such other time in a
particular year as may be designated by written consent of all the shareholders
entitled to vote thereat or which may be designated by resolution of the Board
of Directors.  Such annual meetings
shall be held at the place provided pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof.  Said annual meetings shall be held for the
purpose of the election of directors, for the making of reports of the affairs
of this corporation and for the transaction of such other business as may come
before the meeting.
 
Section 10.3:                             Special
Meetings.  Special meetings of the
shareholders for any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time
by the President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members
thereof, or by one or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten
percent (10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to Section
10.8.  Upon request in writing sent by
registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice President or Secretary,
or delivered to any such officer in person, by any person or persons entitled
to call a special meeting of shareholders (such request, if sent by a
shareholder or shareholders, to include the information required by Section
10.13), it shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, to cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled
to vote that a meeting will be requested by the person or persons calling the
meeting, the date of which meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be
not less than 35 days nor more than 60 days after such request or, if
applicable, determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the
immediately succeeding sentence.  Within
seven days after receiving such a written request from a shareholder or
shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine whether
shareholders owning not less than ten percent (10%) of the shares as of the
record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 for such request support the
call of a special meeting and notify the requesting party or parties of its
finding.
 
Section 10.4:                             Notice
of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting
of shareholders shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60
days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote
thereat by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged
with that duty, or if there be no such officer or person, or in case of his or
her neglect or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the place, date and
hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general
nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be
transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the
Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented
at the meeting for such action except that notice must be given or waived in
writing of any proposal relating to approval of contracts between the
corporation and any director of this corporation, amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or winding up of this
corporation.  The notice of any meeting
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for
election.  Written notice shall be given
by this corporation to any shareholder, either (i) personally or (ii) by mail
or other means of written communication, charges prepaid, addressed to such
shareholder at such shareholders address
 
9







 
appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder
to this corporation for the purpose of notice. 
If a shareholder gives no address or no such address appears on the
books of this corporation, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent by
mail or other means of written communication addressed to the place where the
principal executive office of this corporation is located, or if published at
least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such
office is located.  The notice shall be
deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written
communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided.  An affidavit of delivery or mailing of any notice in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed by the Secretary, Assistant
Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of
the notice.  If any notice addressed to
the shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of
the corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal
Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to
deliver the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall
be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be
available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the
principal executive office of this corporation for a period of one year from
the date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders.
 
Section 10.5:                             Consent
to Shareholders Meetings.  The
transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and
wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if,
either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote,
not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a
consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or approvals shall
be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the
meeting.  Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the
consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not
so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor
the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified
in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of contracts between
this corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or winding up the affairs of
this corporation.
 
Section 10.6:                             Quorum.  The presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Shares shall not be counted to make up a
quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the meeting has been enjoined
or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business
until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
Section 10.7:                             Adjourned
Meetings.  Any shareholders
meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time
by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either
present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in
Section 10.6 hereof, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be
transacted at such meeting.  When a
meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a
meeting.  Except as aforesaid, it shall
not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of the adjourned
meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat other than by announcement
at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken.  At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 10.8:                             Voting
Rights.  Only persons in whose names
shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is
given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be
fixed for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section
2.8(k) hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such
meeting.  In the absence of any contrary
provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable statute
relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters, each such
person shall be entitled to one vote for each share.
 
In order that the corporation may determine the
shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting or request a special meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section
10.3, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14)
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors.  Any
shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the
shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice to the
Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but
in no event later than twenty eight (28) days after the date on which such
request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.
 
Section 10.9:                             Action
by Written Consents.  Any action
which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be
taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving such written consent or
consents from shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall
determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of the record date
established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the minimum number of
votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly
consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its
finding.  Unless the consents of all
shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, notice of any
shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this corporation and any of its
directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, (iii) reorganization of this
corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders upon winding up of this
corporation in certain circumstances without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the
action authorized by such approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the
taking of any other corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting
by less than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote
who have not consented in writing.  All
notices given hereunder shall conform to the requirements of Section 10.4
hereto and applicable law.  When written
consents are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and
accepted from the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of this
corporation at the time such respective consents are given, or any
shareholders proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal
representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke
the consent by a writing received by this corporation prior to the time that
written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed
action have been filed with the Secretary of this corporation, but may not do
so thereafter.  Such revocation is
effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written
consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
 
Section
10.10: Elections of Directors. In any election of
directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of
the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be
elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes
withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  Elections of directors need not be by ballot
except upon demand made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting
begins.
 
11







 
Section 10.11:
Proxies.  Every person entitled
to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or
by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or
such persons duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this
corporation.  No proxy shall be valid
(l) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable
and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and applicable law, or (2) after
the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless the person
executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to
continue in force.  Revocation may be
effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating
that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by
attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the
proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the
death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written
notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy which states that it is irrevocable
is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the
following or a nominee of any of the following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who
has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares
or a person who has sold a portion of such persons shares in this corporation
to the maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or
the shareholder who extended or continued credit to this corporation or the
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given
in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of
the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has contracted
to perform services as an employee of this corporation, if a proxy is required
by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in
consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the
period of employment contracted for, (5) a person designated by or under a
close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable
if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title,
either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms,
discharge the obligation secured by it. 
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy
becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to
purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of this
corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is paid,
the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding
a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge
of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its
irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares.  Every form of proxy or written consent,
which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect
to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked abstain,
whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her
shares on the proposal.  A proxy marked
abstain by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be
voted either for or against such proposal. 
In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors
to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a
shareholder withhold or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the
authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted
either for or against the election of a director.
 
Section 10.12:
Inspectors of Election.  Before
any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons
other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting
or its adjournment.  If no inspectors of
election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request
of any shareholder or a shareholders proxy shall, appoint inspectors of
election at the meeting.  The number of
inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or
more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their
proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (l) or three (3)
inspectors are to be appointed.  If any
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the
Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a
shareholders proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
 
These inspectors shall:
 
12







 
 
(a)                                Determine
the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity,
validity, and effect of proxies;
 
(b)                                 Receive
votes, ballots, or consents;
 
(c)                                  Hear
and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection
with the right to vote;
 
(d)                                 Count
and tabulate all votes or consents;
 
(e)                                  Determine
when the polls shall close;
 
(f)                                    Determine
the result; and
 
(g)                                 Do
any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness
to all shareholders.
 
Section 10.13:  Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals
and Director Nominations. 
Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as directors
at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before a meeting
of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely notice in
proper written form of such shareholders intent to make such nomination or
nominations or to propose such business. 
To be timely, a shareholders notice must be received by the Secretary
of the Corporation not later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided,
however, that in the event less than 70 days notice or prior public disclosure
of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the
shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be 
in proper written form a shareholders notice to the Secretary shall set
forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the
nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be, of the person or
persons to be nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii) a
representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation that intends to vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable,
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person
or persons specified in the notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any
other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such other
information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by
such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been
nominated, or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or
intended to be proposed, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v)
if applicable, the consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so
elected.  The chairman of a meeting of
shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person or the
proposal of any business not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written

of the minutes of the meeting.

of the proceedings of the Board of Directors. Such action by written consent
shall have the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of such directors.

SUNDRY PROVISIONS
 
Section 12.1:                             Instruments
in Writing.  All checks, drafts,
demands for money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of
this corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents,
as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or employee of this
corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by contract or
otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the Board of
Directors.
 
Section 12.2:                             Shares
Held by the Corporation.  Shares in
other corporations standing in the name of this corporation may be voted or
represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the
corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do by
resolution of the Board of Directors.
 
Section 12.3:                             Certificates
of Stock.  There shall be issued to
every holder of shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates signed
in the name of this corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if
any, or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or a Vice President and by
the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the
class or series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be
facsimile.  In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by this
corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer
agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
Section 12.4:                             Lost
Certificates.  Where the owner of
any certificate for shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of
the original certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation
has notice that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, (2) files with this corporation an indemnity bond in such form and
in such amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the
President or a Vice President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies any other
reasonable requirements imposed by this corporation.  The Board of Directors may adopt such other provisions and
restrictions with reference to lost certificates, not inconsistent with
applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem appropriate.
 
Section 12.5:                             Certification
and Inspection of By-Laws.  This
corporation shall keep at its principal executive or business office the
original or a copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise altered to date, which
shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times during
office hours.
 
Section 12.6:                             Annual
Reports.  The making of annual
reports to the shareholders is dispensed with and the requirement that such
annual reports be made to shareholders is expressly waived, except as may be
directed from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President.
 
Section 12.7:                             Fiscal
Quarters. Each fiscal quarter of the Corporation shall be comprised

money or property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is a
director, upon the
 
16







 
approval of the Board of Directors alone.  Such approval by the Board of Directors must be determined by a
vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, if it is determined that
such a loan or guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit the
corporation.  In no event may an officer
owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation be
extended a loan under this provision.
 
Section 12.9:                             Approval
of Certain Transactions.  In
addition to Section 11.5. Quorum hereof, the affirmative vote of a majority of

Article XIII
 
CONSTRUCTION OF BY-LAWS
WITH
REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS
OF LAW
 
Section 13.1:                             By-Law
Provisions Additional and Supplemental to Provisions of Law.  All restrictions, limitations, requirements
and other provisions of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible,
as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the
subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said
provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.
 
Section 13.2:                             By-Law
Provisions Contrary to or Inconsistent with Provisions of Law.  Any article, section, subsection,
subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these By-Laws which, upon being
construed in the manner provided in Section 13.1 hereof, shall be contrary to
or inconsistent with any applicable provision of law, shall not apply so long
as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not
affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it
being hereby declared that these By-Laws, and each article, section,
subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase thereof, would have been
adopted irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections,
subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.

from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the
shareholders; provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation reducing the number or the minimum number of directors to a
number less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption
at a meeting or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written
consent are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote.
 
Section 14.2:                             By
the Board of Directors.  Subject to
the right of shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws, By-Laws, other
than a By-Law or amendment thereof specifying or changing a fixed number of
directors or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a
variable board or vice versa, may be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board
of Directors. A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or eliminate
the power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.

Article XV
 
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
OF STOCK
 
Section 15.1:                             Subsequent
Agreement or By-Law.  If (a) any two
or more shareholders of this corporation shall enter into any agreement
abridging, limiting or restricting the rights of any one or more of them to
sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or transfer on the books
of this corporation any or all of the shares of this corporation held by them,
and if a copy of said agreement shall be filed with this corporation, or if (b)
shareholders entitled to vote shall adopt any By-Law provision abridging,
limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, then, and in
either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such
abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference thereto
endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such certificates shall
not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation except in
accordance with the terms and provisions of such agreement or ByLaw, as the

Article XVI
 
INDEMNIFICATION OF
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER
AGENTS
 
Section 16.1:                             Indemnification
of Directors and Officers.  The
corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the
Code, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (as defined
in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and other
amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding (as
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of the fact that such
person is or was an agent of the corporation. 
For purposes of this Article XVI, a director or officer of the
corporation includes any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation
which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise
at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
Section 16.2:                             Indemnification
of Others.  The corporation shall
have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Code, to
indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers)
against expenses (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines,
settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection
with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Article XVI, an
employee or agent of the corporation (other than a director or officer)
includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation,
(ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a
predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the
request of such predecessor corporation.
 
Section 16.3:                             Payment
of Expenses in Advance.  Expenses
incurred in defending any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which
indemnification is required pursuant to Section 16.1 or for which
indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 16.2 following authorization
thereof by the Board of Directors, shall be paid by the corporation in advance
of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized in this Article XVI.
 
18







 
Section 16.4:                             Indemnity
Not Exclusive.  The indemnification
provided by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to
indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.
 
Section 16.5:                             Insurance
Indemnification.  The corporation
shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted
against or incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of such
persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.
 
Section 16.6:                             Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is
mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:
 
(a)                                  That
it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles of Incorporation,
these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an agreement in effect at the
time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in the
proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
 
(b)                                 That
it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in
approving a settlement.
