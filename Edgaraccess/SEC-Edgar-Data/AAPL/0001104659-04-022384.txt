APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs,
manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals
and personal computing and communicating solutions. The Companys products
include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X
operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software
products and peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business
customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct
sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail stores.
 
Basis of Presentation and
Preparation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Interim
information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Companys management,
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of
interim periods presented have been included. 
The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results to be expected for the entire year. 
Certain prior year amounts in these condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
 
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended
September 27, 2003, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended September 27, 2003 (the 2003 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise
stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys
fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those
fiscal years.
 
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development
costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject
to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been
established and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed. In most instances, the Companys products are released
soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs
incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not
significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial
development costs associated with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of
technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration and release of a
developer beta version, and prior to the release of the final version of the
product in March 2004. Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the
Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the
development of FileMaker Pro 7.  In
accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset began in
March 2004 when FileMaker Pro 7 was shipped and is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation,
as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting
for Stock-based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure as if the
fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The
Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below,
the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires
use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing
employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB
Opinion No. 25, when the exercise
 
5





 
price of the Companys employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
 
As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based
compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock
options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been
estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using
a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures,
the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma
net income over the options vesting period and the shares plan period.
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life
of options and the Companys expected stock price volatility. Because the
Companys employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have
characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options,
and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not
provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares.
 
The Companys pro forma information for the three and nine month
periods ended June 26, 2004 and June 28, 2003 follows (in millions,
except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include
the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted
stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury stock method.  Under the
treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys
common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of
restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive
effect on earnings per share.

shares of common stock for the nine months ended June 26, 2004 and
June 28, 2003, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been
antidilutive.

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of investments
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of
commercial
 
7





 
paper, certificates of deposit, time
deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily
of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with
foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The
Company had net unrealized losses of $6 million as of June 26, 2004 and $1
million as of September 27, 2003 on its investment portfolio, primarily
related to investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year. The Company
occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As
a result of such sales, the Company recognized gains of $1 million and $3
million during the third quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Recognized gains on the sale of short-term
investments were $1 million and $21 million during the first nine months of
2004 and 2003, respectively. These gains were included in interest and other
income, net.
 
As of June 26, 2004, and September 27, 2003, $437 million and
$629 million, respectively, of the Companys investment portfolio that was classified
as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years.  The remainder of the Companys short-term
investments had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months.
 
Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains
The Company has held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),
Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc.
(EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have
been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the
sale of these investments have been included in interest and other income.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold all of its remaining
non-current investments in public companies, consisting of 986,164 shares of
Akamai for net proceeds of approximately $5 million, and a gain before taxes of
$4 million.
 
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining
holdings in both ARM and EarthLink, consisting of 278,000 shares of ARM stock
for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000, and 3,960,000 shares of Earthlink stock for net proceeds of
approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of
EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million,
an amount that approximated the Companys carrying value of the shares.
 
Debt
The Company had debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of
aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994
and were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004. The notes, which
paid interest semiannually, were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield
to maturity of 6.51%.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future
cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time,
the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest
rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting policies
for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as
hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value.  As of the
end of the third quarter of 2004, the general nature of the Companys risk management
activities and the general nature and mix of the Companys derivative financial
instruments have not changed materially from the end of fiscal 2003.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts
with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions.
Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not
hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality,
prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited
availability of appropriate hedging instruments.
 
8





 
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company has historically entered into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with
financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate
interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its
fixed-rate interest expense on any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify
a portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S.
interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that
are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.  The Company does not hold or transact in such
financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.
 
Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for all derivatives at fair value. Derivatives
that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As of
June 26, 2004, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash
flow hedges of approximately $2 million net of taxes, substantially all of
which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the first
quarter of fiscal 2005.

Note 4  Goodwill
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of
approximately $5 million to goodwill related to the acquisition of PowerSchool,
Inc (PowerSchool).  This reduction of
goodwill included the cancellation of 79,167 shares of Apple common stock,
valued at approximately $2 million, that were
previously held in escrow and were refunded upon resolution of certain matters
arising out of the acquisition of PowerSchool. 
This adjustment also included approximately $3 million to adjust the
original estimates of the pre-acquisition PowerSchool restructuring liability
to actual costs incurred.

Note 5  Restructuring Actions
 
2004 Restructuring Actions
During the third quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a charge
related to restructuring activities of approximately $7.9 million.  This charge included finalizing the closure
of the Companys Sacramento manufacturing facility, which was initiated in the
second quarter of 2004.  In the third
quarter of 2004, the Company ceased use of the Sacramento facility and incurred
additional severance costs of $1.9 million. The Company wrote off manufacturing
assets totaling $5.3 million whose use ceased during the third quarter upon
completion of all manufacturing activities in Sacramento.  The remaining charge of approximately $0.7
million relates mainly to management approved actions taken to reduce operating
costs by eliminating non-essential sales and marketing positions primarily in
the Americas segment. These
restructuring actions will ultimately result in the termination of 83
positions, 9 of which had been terminated prior to the end of the third quarter
of 2004.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Companys management approved
restructuring actions that resulted in the recognition of a total restructuring
charge of $9.6 million.  These actions
were related to the closing
of the Companys Sacramento manufacturing operations within the Americas
operating segment and headcount reductions related primarily to various sales
and marketing activities in the Companys Americas and Europe operating
segments.  These restructuring actions
will ultimately result in the termination of 348 positions, 303 of which had
been terminated prior to the end of the third quarter of 2004. The approved
plan to cease manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in severance for
200 employees at a cost of $1.9 million, all of which was spent by the end of
the third quarter of 2004, except for approximately $200,000 which will be paid
before the end of fiscal year 2004. The Company recognized a charge related
primarily to restructuring actions associated with sales and marketing
 
10





 
activities in the United States and Europe for
employee severance costs of $7.7 million, the majority of which will be paid
before the end of fiscal year 2004, for the termination of 148 positions.

2003 Restructuring Actions
The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8
million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred
compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for
lease cancellations.
 
During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount
originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due
to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an
approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to
higher than expected severance costs related to the closure of the Companys
Singapore manufacturing operations. These adjustments had a net neutral effect
on reported operating expense.
 
During the second quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved
and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total
restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs
and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility.
Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to
actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount
reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Companys Americas
and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with
PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an
accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The
second quarter actions resulted in the elimination of 93 positions worldwide.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and
initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted
in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in
Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool
product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of
various sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These
restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide.
 
Closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in
severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write off
manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter
of 2003. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000
and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that
arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain
PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of
2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally
in the United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million
and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of
$6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized
during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of
unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.
 
Of the $26.8 million in total restructuring charges for fiscal 2003,
nearly all had been spent by the end of the third quarter of 2004, except for
approximately $3.6 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned
facilities. The
 
11





 
Company currently anticipates that the remaining accrual for operating
lease costs will be paid over the remaining lease terms.

Note 6  Shareholders Equity
 
Restricted Stock Units
During fiscal 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the grant
of 2.515 million restricted stock units to selected members of the Companys
senior management, excluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  These restricted stock units generally vest
in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of
grant.  The Company has recorded the
$64.4 million value of these restricted stock units as a component of
shareholders equity and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis
over the 4 year requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock
units was based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant. Quarterly amortization will be approximately $4.0 million,
of which approximately $0.5 million will be included in cost of sales; $1.3
million will be included in research and development expense; and the remaining
$2.2 million will be included in selling, general and administrative expense.
The restricted stock units have been included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.
 
CEO Restricted Stock
Award
On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation
and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs,
its CEO.  The Agreement cancelled stock
option awards for the purchase of 27.5 million shares of the Companys common
stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained
options to purchase 60,000 shares of the Companys common stock granted in
August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of the Companys Board of
Directors, prior to becoming the Companys CEO. 
The Agreement replaced the cancelled options with a restricted stock
award of 5 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The restricted stock award generally vests
three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the restricted shares
will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated without cause, dies, or
has his management role reduced following a change in control of the Company.
 
The Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of
$74.75 million as a component of shareholders equity and is amortizing that
amount on a straight-line basis over the 3 year service period.  The value of the restricted stock award was
based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock of $14.95 on
the date of the award. Amortization expense for this award, which amounts to
approximately $6.2 million per quarter, has been included in selling, general,
and administrative expense beginning in March 2003 and will continue to be
included through March 2006.  The 5
million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.
 
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses,
gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net
income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as
their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities
categorized as
 
12





 
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 7  Employee Benefit Plans
 
2003 Employee Stock
Option Plan
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the
shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to
change the name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003
Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to
executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future repricings
of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange
programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The
2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock
options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase
rights.
 
13





 
1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan
In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual
option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10
years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4
years, based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting.
As a result of shareholder approval of amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer
Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan and cancelled all remaining unissued shares totaling 14,295,351
following the completion of an employee stock option exchange program in
October 2003.
 
Employee Stock Option Exchange Program
On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee
stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible
employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors,
had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or
above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options
issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the
Companys common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which was to be at
least six months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled.  On April 17, 2003, in accordance with
the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193
shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options
totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of
$22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys
stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this
transaction.
 
1997 Director Stock
Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee
directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest
in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of
the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully
vested at grant.
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain of the Companys executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D.
Cook, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, and Mr. Bertrand Serlet, have entered into
trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and
dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the
exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Companys employee stock purchase plan.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan
(the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase
common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of
the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering
periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an
employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. As of
June 26, 2004, approximately 2 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan. The number of shares authorized for issuance
is limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period.

The Company had 2.515 million restricted stock units outstanding as of
June 26, 2004, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances
in the preceding tables.  None of these
restricted stock units were vested as of June 26, 2004. The grant of these
restricted stock units has been deducted from the shares available for grant
under the Companys stock option plans.
 
Note 8  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock
compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee
stock purchase plan purchases.
 
15





 
These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model.
 
For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No.
123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as
part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for
using modification accounting.  In
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date
of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees. The
cancellation of certain of the Companys Chief Executive Officers options and
replacement with restricted shares in March 2003 is also being accounted
for using modification accounting for purposes of the pro forma disclosures
provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.
 
The assumptions used for the three and nine month periods ended
June 26, 2004 and June 28, 2003, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average

Note 9  Commitments and Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The Company leases various equipment and facilities,
including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The
Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and
generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases
for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year
renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the Companys total future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of
which $354 million related to leases for retail space.  As of June 26, 2004, total future
minimum lease payments related to leases for retail space increased to $386
million.
 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its
hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically
one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a
90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair
Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost
that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate
accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed
base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected
warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of
specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience.
The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in
future expectations.

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of
its operating system and application software against legal claims that the
software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification
provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in
the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified
third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant
payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or
an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to
indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not
record a liability for infringement costs as of either June 26, 2004 or
September 27, 2003.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer.
These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf
of persons who purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege
violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory
damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit
and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on
June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On
December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss for
failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their
complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on
January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion
to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Companys motion on
July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims with prejudice on
August 12, 2003.  Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims
that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a
potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results
of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company
fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal
matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries
may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in
some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return
product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the
Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and
certain states within the U.S.  Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position.
 
Note 10 - Segment Information and Geographic Data
 
In accordance with SFAS No 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company
reports segment information based on the management approach. The management
approach designates
 
17





 
the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable
segments.
 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan and excludes Japan retail store revenue, which is
included in the Companys Retail segment. The Retail segment currently operates
Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and Japan. Other operating
segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for
Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as
those described in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K in Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail
segment.
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based
on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated based on
operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the
location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales
to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly
attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income
and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating
segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various
corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income
taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research
and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed
general and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses
associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash,
short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and
retail store construction-in-progress that is not
subject to depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures
for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital
expenditures by the Retail segment were $20 million and $30 million during the
third quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $69 million and $60 million
during the first nine months of 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the Companys various
geographic segments.  Certain
manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in segment cost of
sales, including variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and
the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are
included in corporate expenses.
 
Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment
differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Companys geographic
segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended to depict
a comparable measure to that of the Companys major channel partners in the
United States operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail
segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company
makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management
reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the Companys other
segments.
 
First, the Retail segments operating income includes cost of sales for
Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the
United States operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and
incentives provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to support
those partners. For the third quarter of 2004 and 2003, this resulted in the
recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail
segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $48
million and $25 million, respectively. For the first nine months of 2004 and
2003, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above
standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate
expenses of approximately $145 million and $71 million, respectively.
 
Second, the Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the United States, resulting in a
comparable measure of revenue and gross margin between the Companys Retail
stores and those retail channel partners. 
The Retail segment recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of
sales at the time of sale of the
 
18





 
Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts.
Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs
associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is
recognized in other operating segments net sales and cost of sales. For the
third quarter of 2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost
of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating
segments, of $13.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. For the third
quarter of 2003, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail
segment for sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts were $7.1
million and $4.8 million, respectively. For the first nine months of 2004, this
resulted in the recognition of additional net sales and cost of sales by the
Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of
$37.6 million and $25.1 million, respectively. This compares to similar
adjustments to net sales and cost of sales during the first nine months of 2003
of $19.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively.
 
Third, the Company has opened five high profile stores in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Tokyo, Japan as of June 26, 2004 and
has two additional stores under development in Osaka, Japan, and London,
England, which are expected to open by the end of calendar year 2004.  These high profile stores are larger than the
Companys typical retail stores and were designed to further promote brand
awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales and marketing
activities, including corporate briefings. 
As such, the Company allocates certain operating expenses associated
with these stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit
realized Company-wide. The allocation of these operating costs is based on the
excess amount incurred for a high profile store to that of a more typical
Company retail location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting
from the operations of these stores were $4.7 million and $1.1 million in the
third quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $10.9 million and $3.3
million for the first nine months of 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 11  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions
 
In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement
with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used
for Apple business.  The Reimbursement
Agreement became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business
purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company
recognized a total of $220,000 and $105,000 in expenses pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement during the third quarters of 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and $543,000 and $266,000 in expenses for the first nine months
of 2004 and 2003, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company in May
2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5
million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan was secured by a
deed of trust and was due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the
loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options
prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to
the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized
from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number
of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid
$750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003 and repaid the remaining balance of
$750,000 in April 2004.
 
Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased
MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software
and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On
September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW),
acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse
subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.
MicroWarehouse accounted for approximately 0.3% of the Companys net sales for
both the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004, and 2.3% and
2.9% of the Companys net sales for both the three and nine month periods ended
June 28, 2003, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were
$7.1 million and $9.9 million as of June 26, 2004 and September 27,
2003, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate
allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Companys secured interest
position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to
unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were
generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Companys other resellers. In addition, the Company has
purchased miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total
purchases amounted to approximately $431,000 and $1.7 million for the three and
nine month periods ended June 28, 2003. No purchases were made by the Company
from Microwarehouse in the three or nine months ended June 26, 2004.

Executive Overview
Apple designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related
software and services, peripherals and personal computing and communicating
solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores,
direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail
stores. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of
desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital
music player, the iTunes Music Store and digital music management software, and
a portfolio of other software products, peripherals and services for education,
creative, consumer and business customers. 
A further description of the Companys products may be found below and
in Part I, Item 1 of the 2003 Form 10-K under the heading Business.
 
The Company competes in several highly competitive markets including
the personal computer industry with its Macintosh line of computers and related
software, the consumer electronics industry with products such as the iPod, and
digital music distribution through its iTunes Music Store. The Company
continually faces both aggressive pricing practices as well as the emergence of
new competitors in these markets.  In an
effort to remain competitive in these markets, the Company intends to continue
focusing on creating innovative products and services aligned with its digital
hub strategy, whereby the Macintosh functions as the digital hub for digital
devices including the iPod, personal digital assistants, cellular phones,
digital video and still cameras, and other electronic devices.  The Company is also concentrating on
expanding and improving its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail
stores, both domestically and internationally, in high traffic quality shopping
venues; staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees; entering
into strategic alliances with other companies to brand and sell the Companys
products and services; increasing the accessibility of iPods through various
resellers that do not currently sell Macintosh systems; and increasing the reach
of its online stores.
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
requires the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates
that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Companys 2003 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of
 
21





 
which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.
 
Management believes the Companys critical accounting estimates are
those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts,
inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase commitments,
valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles, warranty costs,
and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition
and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain.
 
Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (i.e.,
hardware, software, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition.
 
The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to
the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been
transferred.  For most of the Companys
product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.  For online sales to individuals, for some
sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement
fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed and determinable, revenue is
deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable.
 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments
related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including
reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based
incentives.  The estimated cost of these
programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has
sold the product and committed to a plan. 
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market
conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer
incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that
could result in additional reductions of revenue at the time such programs are
offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management
to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive
based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional
reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the
Companys results of operations.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and
directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company
generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when
possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables
with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring
arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct
customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the
third-party financing company and the end customer.  As such, the Company generally does not
assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these
arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners.
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration
of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers.
The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the
amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible.  The Company also records an allowance for all
other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical
experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial
condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such
receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial
condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to
the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on
trade receivables in general differ from those currently
anticipated, the Company may have to adjust
its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period
the adjustments are made.

Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase
Commitments
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for
inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for
resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each
period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product
lifecycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component
cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If
future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less
favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively
impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to
record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in
the period when the write-downs are recorded.
 
The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to
component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice,
the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial
decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated
change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the
Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees
that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation
fees are identified.
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain
identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their
carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no
material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment
or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those
made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Companys
business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including
deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to
such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are
identified.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
the Company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually,
or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill
for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the Companys business
to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those reporting
units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book
value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value of reporting units
with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the
Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and
liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of
certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process
research and development and developed technology. Once this process is
complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined.
 
Based on the Companys estimates as of June 26, 2004 there was no
impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including
changes in the Companys market capitalization, changes in the Companys
forecasts, and changes in the Companys internal business structure could cause
one or more of the Companys reporting units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the
personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic
conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider
restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result
in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles,
or goodwill.
 
Warranty Costs
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product
warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on the size of
the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and
knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to
assess the
 
23





 
adequacy of its recorded warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.  If actual product failure rates or repair
costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability
would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of
operations.
 
Income Taxes
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax
consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.
 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will
be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event
that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be
realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be
charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the
Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined
to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed,
resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the
period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax
liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of
uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial position.

Net sales during the third quarter of 2004 increased 30% or $469
million from the same quarter in 2003, and were up 32% or $1,437 million for
the first nine months of fiscal 2004 compared to the same period of fiscal
2003.  Several factors contributed to these
increases including:
 
                  Total Macintosh system net sales
increased $169 million or 15% during the third quarter of 2004 and $400 million
or 12% during the first nine months of 2004 compared with the same periods in
2003.  Unit sales also increased 14% and
10% for the three and nine months periods ended June 26, 2004 compared to the
same periods in the prior year. The Companys sale of 876,000 Macintosh units
in its third quarter of 2004 represented the highest quarterly unit shipment in
over 3.5 years.  Unit sales of the
Companys professional desktop and portable systems for the first nine months
of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 increased 24% and 34%,
respectively. The increase in year-to-date Power Macintosh sales is due
primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which did not begin shipping
until the end of fiscal 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales have increased
from the prior year, sales of this product were constrained in the third
quarter of 2004 and will likely be constrained in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 due to manufacturing problems at IBM, the sole supplier of the G5
processor. The foregoing statement concerning the fourth quarter supply of the
G5 processor is forward-looking.  The
actual availability of G5 processors could differ and may negatively impact the
Companys results of operations. In addition, iBook unit sales increased 26% in
the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year.
The Companys portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, continue
to produce strong unit growth of approximately 30% for both the three and nine
months ended June 26, 2004.  Unit sales
of portable systems accounted for 53% and 49% of all Macintosh systems sold
during the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2004,
respectively.  The Company believes that
these results reflect an overall trend in the industry towards portable
systems.
 
Net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 2% for both the third
quarter and first nine months of 2004 compared to the same periods in
2003.  These increases were the result of
various changes in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced Power
Macintosh and PowerBook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from
the Companys retail and online stores. The impact of these factors was
somewhat offset by lower year-over-year pricing for the first nine months of
2004 on comparable Macintosh systems for some of the Companys Macintosh
product lines in response to industry pricing pressure.
 
                  Net sales of
iPods rose $138 million or 124% during the third quarter of 2004 compared to
the same quarter in 2003, and increased $545 million or 243% in the first nine
months of 2004. Strong iPod unit sales of 860,000 and 2.4 million continued to
be experienced in all of the Companys operating segments during the three and
nine month periods ended June 26, 2004, respectively, representing a quarter to
date and year to date increase of 183% and 298%, respectively, over the same
periods in the prior year. This growth was driven by continued strength in
demand for the iPod, introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the
Companys iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music
Store. Since inception of the iPod product line in fiscal 2002, the Company has
sold approximately 3.7 million iPods.
 
                  The Retail
segments net sales grew 86% to $270 million during the third quarter of 2004
and grew by 89% to $809 million in the first nine months of the year compared
to the same periods in the prior year. 
These increases are largely attributable to the increase in total stores
from 59 at the end of the third quarter of 2003 to 80 as of June 26, 2004, as
well as a 31% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the
Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may
elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys
preexisting sales channels in the United States and Japan, the Company believes
that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to
the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the
Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
                  Net sales of
peripherals and other hardware rose by 30% and 41% for the three and nine
months ended June 26, 2004, compared to the same periods in 2003, respectively,
primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer
accessories.  Net sales of other computer
accessories include, AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video
cameras, and third party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of
peripherals and other hardware was experienced predominantly by the Companys
Americas, Europe, and Retail segments.
 
30





 
                  Other music
products consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod
related services and accessories.  Net
sales of Other music products increased 508% and 800% for the three and nine
months ended June 26, 2004, compared to the same periods in 2003, respectively.
The Company has experienced strong growth in quarter and year to date sales of
iPod services and accessories in line with the increase in overall iPod unit
sales. The increase in iTunes Music Store sales is due to the introduction of
the iTunes Music Store for the Macintosh in April of 2003, updated in October
2003 for both Windows and Macintosh users, and introduced in the U.K., France,
and Germany in June 2004.
 
                  Net sales of
software rose $23 million or 26% during the third quarter of 2004 compared to
the same quarter in 2003, and increased $118 million or 43% for the first nine
months of 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases
reflect higher net sales of the Companys Apple-branded software and in
particular, higher net sales of the Companys operating system software, Mac OS
X version 10.3 Panther, which was released in October 2003 and accounted for
approximately $11 million and $68 million of the increase in software net sales
for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004, respectively.
 
                  The Companys
U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of
approximately 16% during the third quarter and 18% for the first nine months of
2004, compared to the same period in 2003, resulting in the Companys highest
U.S. education channel revenue in three years. 
Unit sales also increased by 4% and 6% for the three and nine month
periods ended June 26, 2004 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The
Companys higher education market had strong year over year sales growth of 40%
and 43% for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004 as compared to
the same period in 2003. The Company believes that the K-12 market continues to
be challenged by a weak funding environment; however, revenue in this market
did grow 3% and 1% for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004 as
compared to the same period in 2003.
 
                  Service and
other sales rose 39% and 9% for the third quarter and first nine months of
2004, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2003.  These increases are the result of significant
year-over-year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan
(APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net
sales associated with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales
associated with APP are primarily the result of higher attach rates on APP over
the last several years.
 
Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net
sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 were negatively
impacted by the following:
 
                  Net sales and
unit sales of iMac systems were down 22% and 15%, respectively, during the
third quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003.  This same pattern of decline was also
experienced in the first nine months of 2004 with decreases of 23% and 18% in
net sales and unit sales, respectively. 
Sales of flat panel iMac systems, which have a suggested retail price
starting at $1,299, have been negatively affected by a shift in consumer
preference to portable systems and competitor desktop models with price points
below $1,000.  The Company introduced a
new version of the eMac in April 2004 with a suggested retail price starting at
$799 aimed at the price sensitive customer. 
The age of the current flat panel iMac form factor, which is more than 2
years old, is another factor contributing to weak iMac sales.
 
The Company had planned to release a new iMac, based on the G5
processor, early in the fourth quarter of 2004. 
However, because of the manufacturing problems at IBM, the Company could
not secure sufficient supply of G5 processors to launch the new iMac as
originally scheduled and now plans on announcing and shipping the new iMac in
September. Also, in anticipation of this new product transition, the Company
curtailed purchase of components required for production of the current flat
panel iMac.  As such, the Company has stopped
taking orders for the current flat panel iMac and existing inventory is
expected to be depleted prior to the availability of the new iMac.
 
                  Net sales in the
Companys Japan segment increased 2% for the third quarter on a year-over-year
basis, and decreased 5% for the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same
period in 2003.  Unit sales in Japan were
down 4% and 11%, respectively during the third quarter and first nine months of
2004 versus the same periods in 2003. These declines are believed to be
attributable to the weakness in consumer PC shipments throughout Japan, the
Companys belief that its professional and creative customers have delayed
computer
 
31





 
upgrades pending the release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native
applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, and a shift in sales from the Japan
Segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of the Tokyo store in
the first quarter of 2004. When sales from the Japan retail store are included
in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue resulted in an 8%
year-over-year increase for the three months ended June 26, 2004 and was flat
for the nine months ended June 26, 2004 as compared to the same period in the
prior year. See additional comments below related to the Japan segment under
the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the
Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as
well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan and excludes
Japan retail store revenue, which is included in the Companys Retail
segment.  The Retail segment currently
operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and opened its first
international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys
operating segments may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 10, Segment
Information and Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment grew 23% or $187 million in the third
quarter of 2004 compared with the same quarter in 2003.  For the first nine months of 2004, net sales
grew $570 million, a 25% increase, compared to the same period of 2003.  The increase in net sales was primarily
attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well
as from strong sales of peripherals, software, and services.  Macintosh unit sales had a 4% increase for
both the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004 driven primarily from
strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by
continued weakness in iMac sales.
 
As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in U.S. education
channel net sales of 16% for the third quarter and 18% for the nine month
periods of 2004 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Strong U.S.
education net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of the year
relate primarily to strength in higher education net sales that drove
year-over-year growth of 40% and 43% for the three and nine months periods
ended June 26, 2004, respectively. The Companys K-12 net sales grew
year-over-year by 3% and 1% for the three and nine months ended June 26, 2004,
respectively, despite the challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget
constraints and increased competition.
 
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased
$111 million or 37% during the third quarter of 2004 as compared to the same
quarter in 2003, and increased $390 million or 40% for the first nine months of
2004 compared to the same period in 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe
were particularly strong in the third quarter and first nine months of 2004, up
33% and 17%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2003.  Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe
experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except for the iMac, in
the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004. Demand in Europe during
these periods was particularly strong for the Companys professional Macintosh
systems, iPods, peripherals and software.
 
Japan
Japans net sales increased $4 million or 2% during the third quarter
of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003, and decreased $25 million or 5%
for the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.  Unit sales in Japan were down 4% and 11% for
the third quarter and first nine months of 2004, respectively, compared to the
same periods in the prior year. These decreases in net sales and unit sales are
believed to be attributable in part to negative growth in consumer PC shipments
that continues to be experienced throughout Japan, which has contributed to the
decrease in net sales of the Companys Macintosh systems. The Company also
believes that some professional and creative customers have delayed upgrades to
their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors porting their
applications to Mac OS X in Japan, including Quark XPress 6, which is expected
to occur later in fiscal year 2004.  In
addition, such decreases may be attributable in part to a shift in sales from
the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of the Tokyo
store in the first quarter of 2004. The decrease in net sales was
 
32





 
partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during the three and
nine month periods ended June 26, 2004. Japans net sales and Macintosh unit
sales continue to remain significantly below their historic levels.
 
Retail
The Company opened two new retail stores during the second quarter,
bringing the total number of open stores to 80 as of the end of the third
quarter of 2004.  This compares to 59
stores open as of the end of the third quarter of 2003. The Company plans to
open two more international stores before the end of the calendar year, one in
Osaka, Japan and the other in London, England. The Retail segments third
quarter 2004 net sales grew by $125 million or 86% from the same quarter in
2003.  Net sales for the first nine
months of 2004 grew to $809 million from $428 million during the same period of
2003, a 89% increase.
 
With an average of 79 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly
revenue per store increased to $3.4 million, up from $2.6 million in the
year-ago quarter. The Retail segment has contributed strongly to the increase
in net sales of peripherals and software experienced by the Company during
2004. During the first nine months of 2004, approximately 54% of the Retail
segments net sales came from the sale of iPods, other Apple-branded and
third-party peripherals, software and services. This compares to 44% for the
Retail segment during the first nine months of 2003 and 38% for the Company as
a whole during the first nine months of 2004.
 
In accordance with the
Companys operating segment reporting, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1
of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
at Note 10, Segment Information and Geographic Data, the Retail segment
reported profit of $7 million and $21 million during the third quarter and
first nine months of 2004 as compared to losses of $2 million and $6 million
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2003. This improvement is
primarily attributable to the segments year-over-year increase in average
quarterly revenue per store and the impact of opening new stores.
 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure,
operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital
expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled
$290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, and totaled $69 million during the
first nine months of 2004. As of June 26, 2004, the Retail segment had
approximately 1,720 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments
associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $386
million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to
terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could
adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition.
Investment in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently
risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved, overall
economic uncertainties, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the
Retail segments operating expenses.

with gross margin of 27.7% for the same period in 2003. The decline in gross
margins for the nine months ended June 26, 2004 was primarily due to the
increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on
certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during 2004, and
higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products.

Research
and Development (R&D)
R&D increased
by 4% and 2% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2003 primarily due to increased R&D
headcount to support expanded R&D activities and employee salary merit
increases. R&D as a percentage of net sales decreased to approximately 6%
in both the three and nine months ended June 26, 2004 as compared to
approximately 8% in the same periods of the prior year due to the significant
increase in total net sales for the Company of 30% and 32% for the three and
nine month periods, respectively. The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive
position in the marketplace and expects to continue to invest heavily in
R&D to remain competitive.
 
In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company expects to capitalize R&D costs of
approximately $5 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger.  The foregoing statement concerning the
capitalization of software development costs is forward-looking.  The Companys actual results could differ.
 
Selling,
General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)
Expenditures for
SG&A increased $55 million and $144 million, respectively, for the three
and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004 compared to the same periods in
2003.  These increases are due primarily
to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on
marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with
restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses
resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases.
 
Restructuring
Costs
During the third
quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a charge related to restructuring
activities of approximately $7.9 million. 
This charge included finalizing the closure of the Companys Sacramento
manufacturing facility, which was initiated in the second quarter of 2004.  In the third quarter of 2004, the Company
ceased use of the Sacramento facility and all related manufacturing assets and
incurred additional severance costs of $1.9 million. The Company wrote off
assets totaling $5.3 million whose use ceased during the third quarter upon
completion of all manufacturing activities in Sacramento.  The remaining charge of approximately $0.7
million relates mainly to actions taken to reduce operating costs by
eliminating non-essential positions primarily in the Americas segment. These restructuring actions will
ultimately result in the termination of 83 positions, 9 of which had been
terminated prior to the end of the third quarter of 2004
 
During the second
quarter of 2004, the Companys management approved restructuring actions that resulted
in the recognition of a total restructuring charge of $9.6 million.  These actions were related to the closing of the Companys Sacramento
manufacturing operations within the Americas operating segment and headcount
reductions related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the
Companys Americas and Europe operating segments.  These restructuring actions will ultimately
result in the termination of 348 positions, 303 of which had been terminated
prior to the end of the third quarter of 2004. The approved plan to cease
manufacturing operations in Sacramento resulted in severance for 200 employees
at a cost of $1.9 million, all of which was spent by the end of the third
quarter of 2004, except for approximately $200,000 which will be paid before
the end of fiscal year 2004. The Company recognized a charge related primarily
to restructuring actions associated with sales and marketing activities in the
United States and Europe for employee severance costs of $7.7 million, the
majority of which will be paid before the end of fiscal year 2004, for the
termination of 148 positions.
 
34





 
The Company
estimates the closing of the Sacramento manufacturing operations will result in
reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $2 million.  In addition, the Company estimates that the
remaining restructuring actions taken in the second and third quarter of fiscal
2004 will ultimately result in reduced ongoing quarterly operating expenses of
approximately $5 million.
 
In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company expects to incur restructuring charges of
approximately $5 million primarily related to vacating certain European sales
office space. The foregoing statement concerning restructuring costs is
forward-looking.  The Companys actual
results could differ.
 
The Company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the
year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in
severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1
million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations.
 
During the third
quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for
lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a
property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000
shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected
severance costs related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had a net neutral effect on reported operating
expense.
 
During the second
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8
million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset
write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the
second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the
prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales
and marketing functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the
Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease
payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the
elimination of 93 positions worldwide.
 
During the first quarter of
2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of
manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further
reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product
strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various
sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These
restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide.

Gain on
Sales of Non-current Investments
During the first quarter of
2004, the Company sold its remaining non-current investments in public
companies consisting of 986,164 shares of Akamai Technologies for net proceeds
of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of $4 million. As of June
26, 2004, the Company does not have any non-current public company investments
reflected in its condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the first quarter
of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds
of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the
 
35





 
Companys carrying value of the
shares sold. No sales of the Companys non-current debt and equity investments
were made in the second quarter of 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, the
Company sold 278,000 shares of ARM Holdings plc (ARM) stock for net proceeds of
approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of $270,000.  During the third quarter of 2003, the Company
also sold 3,960,000 shares of EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink) stock for net
proceeds of approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million.
 
Interest
and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other
income, net decreased $2 million or 13% to $13 million during the third
quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003 and decreased $33 million
or 49% for the first nine months of 2004 from the same period in 2003. These
decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the
Companys cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market interest
and a shortening of the average maturity of the Companys investment portfolio.
The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.27% in the third quarter of
2004 compared to the 1.40% rate earned during the same period in 2003. The
Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated
maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net gains of $1
million during the third quarter of 2004 and $3 million during the third
quarter of 2003. Such gains were $1 million and $21 million during the first
nine months of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The sale of short-term
investments during the first nine months of 2003 was intended to shorten the
average maturity of the Companys investment portfolio based on managements
belief that interest rates were at or near their bottom.
 
Interest expense consisted
primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal
amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004;
partially offset by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001
that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured
notes. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield
to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt
swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes
maturity in February 2004.
 
Provision
for Income Taxes
The Companys
effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 2004 was
approximately 28%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory
federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign
earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended
to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and due to research and
development credits.
 
The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has completed its audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for
all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these
adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office.  Substantially all IRS audit issues for these
years have been resolved.  In addition,
the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax
authorities.  Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in
a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs.
 
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2003, the
Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.
104, Revenue Recognition, which supercedes
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.  SAB 104 clarifies existing guidance regarding
revenue contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00-21. 
The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Companys
results of operations or financial position.
 
In December 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 46R, a
revision to FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.  FIN 46R
clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from
its requirements.  FIN 46R is effective
at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004.  The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a
material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position.
 
In March 2004, the FASB issued
EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.
EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment
 
36





 
losses on debt and equity
investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are
deemed to be temporarily impaired. The accounting guidance of EITF 03-1 is
effective for years beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure
requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004.
Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03-1,
management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on
its results of operations or financial position.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently measures
compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per
share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring
compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25
because, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q at Note 1 of
the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the alternative fair
value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the
exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
On March 31, 2004, the FASB
issued a proposed Statement, Share-Based Payment,
that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of
the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such
equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to
account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25 and
generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method.  If adopted in
its current form, the proposed Statement would be effective for the Company
beginning in its fiscal year 2006.
 
At the Companys annual
shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal
requesting that the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy
of expensing the value of all future employee stock options issued by the
Company. The Board and management appreciate and take seriously the views
expressed by the Companys shareholders. The Company decided not to expense the
value of employee stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting
standard on the matter, which will play a significant role in determining the
fair value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors
progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue
of employee stock compensation. The Company is currently reviewing the
potential impact from the guidance of the proposed statement, which may require
the Company to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future
periods that could have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results
of operations.

As of June 26, 2004, the Company had $4.966 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $400 million over
the same balances at the end of fiscal 2003. Approximately $3.0 billion of this
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by the Companys
foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation to the U.S. The principal components of this increase were cash
generated by operating activities of $491 million, and proceeds of $319 million
from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash
used to repay the Companys outstanding debt of $300 million and purchases of
property, plant, and equipment of $117 million.
 
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing
operations over the next 12 months.
 
Debt
The Company had debt
outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5%
unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994 and were repaid upon their
maturity in February 2004. The notes, which paid interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.
 
Capital
Expenditures
The Companys total capital
expenditures were $117 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2004, $69
million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the
Companys Retail segment and $48 million of which were for corporate
infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating
facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it
will utilize approximately $200 million for capital expenditures during 2004,
approximately $121 million of which is expected to be utilized for expansion of
the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal
replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information
technology infrastructure.
 
Stock
Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. 
This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a
total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was
authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock
as of June 26, 2004.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has
not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the
Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to
material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
 
Lease
Commitments
As of September 27, 2003, the
Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of
approximately $600 million, $354 million of which related to the lease of
retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing
operating leases range from 2 to 11 years. Total outstanding commitments on
noncancelable operating leases related to the lease of retail space rose to
$386 million as of June 26, 2004.
 
Purchase
Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes several
contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products
and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract
manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information
supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3
months. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a
wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the
Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase
commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature
of the Companys outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and
component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the end of
its fiscal 2003.  As of June 26, 2004,
the
 
38





 
Company had outstanding
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of
approximately $735 million.
 
Indemnifications
The Company generally does not
indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes
include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to
costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company
or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to
make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim
asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of
management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved
infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 
Factors
That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
 
Because of the
following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating
results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors
should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future
periods.
 
General
economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could
adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the
financial health of its suppliers, distributors,
and resellers.
The Companys
operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For
much of the past several years, demand for the Companys products has been
negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some
of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases
due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget
deficits on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future
economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.
Should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or deteriorate,
demand for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the
financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
 
War,
terrorism or public health issues could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of
products, which could negatively affect the Companys operations and
performance.
War, terrorism or public health
issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause
damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and
political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global
economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers.  Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences
or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in
demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver
products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and
could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. The
Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the
future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events.
 
The Company and some of its
manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in
various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which were
subject to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) travel advisories at times
during fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a
significant amount of both the Companys portable Macintosh systems and iPods are
assembled. Should the severity of the SARS threat increase or other public
health issues arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for
more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers.
 
The market
for personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly
competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets,
its results of operations could be adversely affected.
The personal computer industry
is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices,
downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products,
short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement
in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological
and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of
consumers, and a large number of competitors.
 
39





 
Over the past several years,
price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals
has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell Windows-based
personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product
margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness
in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing
products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and
other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
The personal computer industry
has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software
functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging
industry standards.  Further, as the
personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the
Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler
than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the
Companys existing products.  Several
competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to
target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer,
education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and
publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced
plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the unique design,
technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a
significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial,
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader
product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.
Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal
computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger
competitors in the Companys markets.
 
The Company is currently the
only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share
in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers
utilizing Microsofts Windows operating systems. The Companys future operating
results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to
continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain
perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including
Windows.
 
The Company is currently
focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and
related consumer electronic devices including iPods. The Company faces
increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music
distribution services, free peer-to-peer music services, emerging companies,
and larger companies that may have greater resources, including technical and
marketing resources, and supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete
could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide
products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully
distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S.
 
The Company
has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative
costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent
upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and
competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the
Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue
than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating
systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and
maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the
Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys
brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling
costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company
is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with
attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by its operating cost structure.
 
The Company
must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in
order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly volatile
nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic
customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must
continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products
in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new
products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success
of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including
market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with
product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of
application software for new products; the effective management of inventory
levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new
products may
 
40





 
have quality or other defects
in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine
in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or
results of operations.
 
During 2001, the Company
introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first
major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major upgrades include Mac OS X
Jaguar in 2002 and most recently Mac OS X Panther in October 2003. Inability of
the Company to provide additional improvements in the performance and
functionality of the Mac OS, inability to advance customer acceptance of the
operating system and its upgrades, inability to obtain the continued commitment
of software developers to transition existing applications to run on the Mac OS
or create new applications to run on the Mac OS, may have an adverse impact on
the Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
Because
orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components,
must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial
inventory risk.
The Company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete
or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues
necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have
been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related
provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the
Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition,
such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.
 
The Company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast
incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient
inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice,
components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in
customer demand patterns.
 
Future
operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a
sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are
in short supply or available only from limited sources.
Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key
components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and
optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company
from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and
pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often
initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the
Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies,
additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the
suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal
computer industry also compete for various components with other industries
that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer
industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of
these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on
the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys
requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or
constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to
produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and
desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based
microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company
with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features
that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel
Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by
personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts
to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of
its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz
rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh
systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide
 
41





 
advanced PowerPC
microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on
the Companys results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the
Companys sole supplier of the G5 processor, which is used in the Companys
current Power Macintosh and Xserve products, and the next version of the iMac.
Motorola is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the
Companys eMac and portable products. IBM has experienced manufacturing
problems with the G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the
shipment of various products and will likely constrain certain product
shipments during the fourth quarter of 2004. The inability of IBM to remedy
these problems in a timely manner, avoid significant manufacturing problems in
the future, and to deliver to the Company microprocessors in sufficient
quantities with competitive price/performance features could further constrain
shipments of products containing the G5 processor and could adversely affect
the Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company
relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company
on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts with
third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Companys
iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to
offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Companys licensing
arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature
and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially
reasonable terms, if at all.  Certain
parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their
music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase
the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music
Store. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music
content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand
its geographic reach outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of
the Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals,
including iPods, may be adversely affected.
 
Third-party content providers
and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management
solutions and other security mechanisms. 
If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the
Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address
such new rights and requirements.  There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could
have a materially adverse affect on the Companys operating results and
financial position.
 
The Company
is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties,
many of whom are located outside of the United States.
Most of the Companys products
are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition,
the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.
While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they
also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It
is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or
quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to
respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with
such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement,
the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer
for warranty service in the event of product defects.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty
liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or
otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and
financial condition.
 
Final assembly of products sold
by the Company is currently conducted in the Companys manufacturing facility
in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton,
California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and
the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in
the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys
portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by
third-party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing
or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic,
business, environmental, medical, political, information technology system
failures, or military conditions or events, the Companys results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The
Companys products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can
result in decreased net sales and operating profits.
The Company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere
with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in
 
42





 
components and products the
Company purchases from third-parties that may be beyond its control. There can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in
the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost
revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to
remedy.
 
The
Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties.
Through June 2004, the Company
has opened 80 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information
systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into
substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms
ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it
choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs
could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial
condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segments
costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease
expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment
experience a decline in sales for any reason.
 
Certain of the Companys stores
have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as
vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand
awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold
improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has
opened five such stores and plans to open high profile stores in London,
England and Osaka, Japan by the end of the calendar year. Because of their
location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter
into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those
required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have
terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with total commitments per location over the
lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor
performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly
significant negative impact on the Companys results of operations and
financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks and
uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail
segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could
adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results
to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties
unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail
segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a
negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance
of the Companys retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh
platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at
adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel
partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the United
States; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of
Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality
retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
Declines in
unit sales of the Companys professional products or increases in sales of
consumer products may negatively impact the Companys gross margin percentage.
Unit sales of the Companys
professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems,
generally have higher individual gross margins than the Companys other product
offerings.  The Company believes that
weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant
users of such systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys current
and potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who
are most likely to utilize such systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz
rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its
Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating
systems and translates to slower overall system performance. A shift in sales
mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer
products, including the iPod, iBook, iMac and content from the iTunes Music
Store, could adversely affect the Companys future gross margin and operating
margin percentages.
 
43





 
The Company
faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market.
Sales in the
United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college
and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in
this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted
or announced their intention to target the education market for personal
computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an
effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and
will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The
Companys 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook
portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network
connected to a central server.  These 1:1
learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more
aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in
financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it
has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain
its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic
arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys
operating results and financial condition.
 
The
Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of
distributors and other resellers of the Companys products.
The Company distributes its
products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and
cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In
addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain
third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users,
certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores
around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain
third-party products through its retail stores. Many of the Companys
significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been
negatively affected by recent economic conditions. Considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The
Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the
financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer
channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if
uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to
reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products.  The Company has invested and will continue to
invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing
selected resellers stores with Company employees.  These programs could require a substantial
investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or
incremental revenue to offset this investment.
 
Over the past several years, an
increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by the Company
directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through
its retail stores in the United States. Some of the Companys resellers have
perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with
their own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the
Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the
Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and
sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of
the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be
adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or
all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products.
 
Further information regarding
risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1
of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2003 under the heading
Markets and Distribution.
 
The
Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.
A large portion of the
Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result,
the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly
affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on
foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are
purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia,
Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses
incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly
the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the
Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency
denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign
currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components,
negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
44





 
Margins on sales of the
Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include
components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Derivative instruments, such as
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and
option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The use of such hedging activities may not
offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.
 
Further information related to
the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of the 2003
Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2003 under the subheading Foreign
Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of the 2003 Form 10-K for
the year ended September 27, 2003 at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
The
Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third-party
software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed
or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not
to buy the Companys products.
The Company believes that
decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed
to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party
software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also
believes the availability of third-party application software for the Companys
hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception and
analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading
such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows
market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the
Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be
generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing
such software products. To the extent the Companys financial losses in prior
years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal
computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS licensing
program, have caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in
the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new
application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products
and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading
software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance
software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the
Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and future
development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may
negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and
upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company
currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by
professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the
decision of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade
Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently
marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video and
digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based
database management, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets
an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page
layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a
single application.
 
In August 1997, the
Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and
technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August
2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh
computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its
Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although
Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X,
Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products
subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with
Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its
efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete
directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts
interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration
of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests
as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft
Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an
adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. In June of
2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet
Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsofts decision to discontinue development of
Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced
 
45





 
in part by the Companys
introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what
impact, if any, Microsofts decision to cease further development of Internet
Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if customers chose not
to purchase the Companys products because Internet Explorer is not available
on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide support for web
browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Companys net sales and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
The
Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property
obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be
adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the
intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys products
are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to
various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that
based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could
be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance
that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable
terms.
 
Because of technological
changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the
Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing
patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may
be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others.
Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming,
result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and
technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of
evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into
licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be
given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation
will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered
prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a
successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay
royalties to a third-party, the Companys future operating results and
financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain
claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent
infringement and other matters is set forth in Part II, Item 1 of this Form
10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2003 Form 10-K. 
In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential
liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims
related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of
others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the
results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should
the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of
patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part II,
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year
ended September 27, 2003 or should several of these matters be resolved against
the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Company
expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety
of reasons.
The Companys profit margins
vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall
profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the
product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that periods net sales.
 
The typical
concentration of net sales in the third month of the Companys fiscal quarters
can adversely affect the Companys business and operating results.
The Company generally sells
more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either
of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry.
This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal
infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the
Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments
late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys
products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key
logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have
significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and
financial condition.
 
The
Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key
personnel.
Much of the future success of
the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive
team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys employees are located.
 
46





 
The Company has relied on its
ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining
this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations requiring the
expensing of stock options may impair the Companys future ability to provide
these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be
no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain
key personnel.
 
The Company
is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed
rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all
areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in
higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For
some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have
insurance coverage.  For these reasons,
the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has
in the past at relatively greater cost.
 
Business
interruptions could adversely affect the Companys future operating results.
The Companys major business
operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages,
terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions,
and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and
development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology
systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The
Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses.
The Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or
manmade disaster.
 
Failure of information technology systems and
breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely
affect the Companys future operating results.
Information technology system failures and
breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in
the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of
customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting
in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management
has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing
sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there
can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the
Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operations.
 
The Company
is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened
during periods when economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its products
through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain
educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of
the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or
credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of
its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw
material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company
has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its
trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures
will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally,
if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to
deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss
or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of
its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The Company
is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S.  Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and
the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
operation and financial position.
 
Changes in
accounting rules could adversely affect the Companys future operating results.
Financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange
 
47





 
Commission (SEC), who interpret
and create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting
regulations could have a significant effect on the Companys results of
operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business.
 
Unanticipated
changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future effective
tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes
in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes
in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its
income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income
taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results
and financial condition.
 
The
Companys stock price may be volatile.
The Companys stock has at
times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market
price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the
operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of
positive performance in the Companys stock price, as well as general economic
and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of
corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may
materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the
future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock price may result in
greater dilution of earnings per share.
 
The
Companys acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may
present risks not contemplated at the time of the transaction.
The Company has acquired and
may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and
technologies that complement the Companys strategic direction and product
roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies operations and
technologies; distraction of managements attention away from normal business
operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and
expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in
the Companys due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal
contingencies.  Acquisitions are
inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Companys previous or
future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect
business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally
paid cash for its acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or
other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition,
current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become
diluted.
 
For a discussion of these and other factors affecting
the Companys future results and financial condition, see Item 7, Managements
Discussion and Analysis - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial
Condition and Item 1, Business in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K.
 
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk
profile has not changed significantly from that described in the 2003 Form
10-K.
 
Interest
Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management
To ensure the
adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys foreign exchange and interest rate
hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the
non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange
forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions
both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign
currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an
accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons
of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the
exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic
exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results
and financial position.
 
48





 
Interest
Rate Risk
While the Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized
countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to
fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard,
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated
with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys fixed income
investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet
liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and
interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing
external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment
portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies
and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements
internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.
 
During 1994, the Company issued
$300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a
public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par,
for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes paid interest
semiannually and matured in February 2004. The Company used existing cash
in the second quarter of 2004 to settle these notes upon maturity.
 
The Companys exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys
investment portfolio and related derivative financial instruments. The Company
places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by high
credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal
loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit
risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less are
classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities
greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. As of June
26, 2004, approximately $437 million of the Companys short-term investments
had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had
underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in
anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management
of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior
to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized
net gains of $1 million during the third quarter of 2004 and $3 million during
the third quarter of 2003. Such gains were $1 million and $21 million during the
first nine months of fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
The Company has
historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company
may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the
cost of the interest rate risk management program.  The Company entered into no interest rate
asset swaps during the first nine months of either 2004 or 2003 and had no open
interest rate asset swaps at June 26, 2004.
 
In prior years, the Company had
entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest
rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the
Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month U.S.
dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the
underlying notional amounts.  These swaps
effectively converted the Companys fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate
debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate.
Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into
and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6
million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap
positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were
deferred, recognized in long-term debt and were amortized to other income and
expense through the maturity of the debt in February 2004.
 
Foreign
Currency Risk
Overall, the Company is a net
receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally
benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates,
and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the
Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is
also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing
within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when
there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
49





 
The Company enters into foreign
currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to
protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly
committed transactions. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures.
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of
certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Based on an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of June 26, 2004 to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms.
 
There were no
significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
identified in managements evaluation during the third quarter of fiscal 2004
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed below. The Company is
also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. In
the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related
to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

misrepresentation and concealment.  Plaintiff requests unspecified damages
and other relief. The Company filed a demurrer and motion to strike which were
granted, in part, and Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.  The Company
filed an answer on April 17, 2003 denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  Plaintiffs subsequently amended their
complaint and the Company expects that they will make further amendments. 
On October 29, 2003, the Company filed a motion to disqualify Plaintiffs
counsel in his role as counsel to the purported class and to the general
public.  The Court granted the motion, but allowed Plaintiff to retain
substitute counsel.  Plaintiff did engage new counsel for the general
public, but not for the class.  The Company moved to disqualify
Plaintiffs new counsel and to have the Court dismiss the general public claims
for equitable relief.  The Court declined to disqualify Plaintiffs new
counsel or to dismiss the equitable claims, but did confirm that the class
action claims are dismissed.  The case is stayed pending an appeal.

Dynacore
Holdings Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff Dynacore filed this
action on June 6, 2001 in United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against the Company and thirteen other defendants claiming
patent infringement relating to IEEE 1394 technology, also known as FireWire.
Plaintiff claimed that any computer system or other electronic product that
uses or complies with the IEEE 1394 standard violates the patent. Plaintiff
sought unspecified damages and other relief. The Company answered the
complaint, denied all allegations and asserted numerous affirmative defenses.
The Company also asserted counterclaims requesting declaratory judgment for
non-infringement and invalidity. The case was initially stayed pending the
Federal Circuits decision in Datapoint Corp. v. Standard Microsystems Corp., a
related case in which plaintiff claimed that its patent was infringed by
products complying with the fast Ethernet standard. In February 2002, the
Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment of non-infringement in Datapoint, and the
District Court lifted the stay in this action. The defendants in this action
filed a joint motion for summary judgment based upon the decision in Datapoint.
The Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on
February 11, 2003.  Dynacore appealed the ruling. The Federal Circuit
Court heard argument on January 5, 2004 and on March 31, 2004 affirmed the
ruling in Defendants favor.  Plaintiff
did not appeal that decision and the case is closed.

class action on September 22, 2003 in Los Angeles County Superior Court
against the Company and other members of the industry on behalf of a nationwide
class of purchasers of certain computer hard drives.  The case alleges
violations of Civil Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition), the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) and false advertising related to the size
of the drives.  Plaintiffs allege that calculation of hard drive size
using the decimal method misrepresents the actual size of the drive.  The
complaint seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The Company is beginning
its investigation of these allegations. 
Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 30, 2004.

Hawaii
Structural Iron Workers and Pension Trust Fund v. Apple Computer, Inc. and
Steven P. Jobs; Young v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al; Hsu v. Apple Computer Inc.
et al.
Beginning on September 27,
2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and
purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys publicly
traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000.
The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek
unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these
claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company
filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on
September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the
Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave
to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard
the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims with
prejudice on August 12, 2003.  Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.
 
MacTech
Systems v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Macadam v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Computer
International, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Elite Computers and Software, Inc.
v. Apple Computer, Inc.; The Neighborhood Computer Store v. Apple Computer,
Inc. (All in Santa Clara County Superior Court).
Five resellers have filed
similar lawsuits against the Company for various causes of action including
breach of contract, fraud, negligent and intentional interference with economic
relationship, negligent misrepresentation, trade libel, unfair competition and
false advertising. Plaintiffs request unspecified damages and other
relief.   The Company answered the Computer International complaint
on November 12, 2003 denying all allegations and asserting numerous
affirmative defenses.  Macadam filed a fourth amended complaint on June 4,
2004.  The Company filed a demurrer to
certain causes of action in the complaint, which is scheduled to be heard on
August 26, 2004.  The Company expects the
other plaintiffs to file amended complaints.  On October 1, 2003, one
of the resellers, Macadam was deauthorized as an Apple reseller. Macadam filed
a motion for a temporary order to reinstate it as a reseller, which the Court
denied.  The Court denied Macadams motion for a preliminary injunction on
December 19, 2003. The parties are in discovery.
 
Palmieri v.
Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this purported
class action on September 5, 2003 in Los Angeles County Superior Court on
behalf of a nationwide class of purchasers of certain PowerBooks.  The
case alleges violations of Civil Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition)
and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) arising from an alleged design
defect in the PowerBooks which purportedly causes marks and dead pixels in the
LCD screens.  Plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege an additional
defect in the new 15 PowerBook, introduced in September 2003, which
purportedly causes white spots on the screen.  The complaint seeks
unspecified damages and other relief.  The Company filed an answer on
January 8, 2004 denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative
defenses.  The case has been settled and the complaint dismissed.  Settlement of this matter did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operation.
 
Shipman v.
Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this patent
infringement action on April 15, 2004 in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California for infringement of patent 6,217,183 related
to a Keyboard Having Illuminated Keys. Plaintiff alleges that the Companys
PowerBooks introduced in 2003 infringe this patent.  Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, a
preliminary injunction, and other relief. 
The case has been settled and the complaint dismissed.  Settlement of this matter did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operation.
 
Teleshuttle
Technologies, LLC and BTG International Inc. v. Microsoft and Apple Computer,
Inc.
Plaintiff filed this case on
July 20, 2004 in United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging infringement of US patent 6,557,054, entitled Method and
System for Distributing Updates by Presenting Directory of Software Available
for User Installation That is Not Already Installed on User Station.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction and unspecified
damages.  The Companys response to the
complaint is not yet due.
 
TIBCO
Software, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this case on
August 27, 2003 in United States District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging trademark infringement by the Company for using the mark
Rendezvous. Plaintiffs mark is TIBCO Rendezvous.  The complaint
sought unspecified damages and other relief.  The Company answered the
complaint, denied all allegations and asserted numerous affirmative
defenses.  The Company also asserted counterclaims requesting a
declaratory judgment for non-infringement, invalidity and no dilution. 
The case has been settled and the
 
54





 
complaint dismissed.  Settlement of this matter did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
 
Virgin
Mega/French Competition Council.  On 
June 28, 2004 Virgin Mega filed a complaint against Apple Computer
France with the French Competition Council alleging that the Company has
wrongfully refused to license Fairplay DRM technology to competitors.  Virgin is seeking Interim Measures, pending
the determination of the merits of the case. 
A hearing on Virgins request for such measures will likely be heard in
October or November 2004.

Exhibit
3.3
 
BY-LAWS
 
OF
 
APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
(a California
corporation)
 
 
(as amended through June
7, 2004)
 
 
Article I
 
OFFICES
 
Section 1.1:            Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop,
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board
of Directors is hereby granted full power and authority to change the location
of the principal executive office from one location to another.
 
Section 1.2:
           Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at such
place or places within or without the State of California as it deems
appropriate.
 
Article II
 
DIRECTORS
 
Section 2.1:            Exercise of
Corporate Powers.  Except as
otherwise provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors.
 
Section 2.2:
           Number.  The number of directors of the corporation
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of directors shall be seven
(7) until changed within the limits specified above, by a by-law amending this
section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders. The
indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite number fixed
without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law duly adopted by the
vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed
number or the minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot
be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the
shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written
consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote.  No amendment may change the
stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two
times the stated minimum number of directors minus one.
 
Section 2.3:            Need Not Be
Shareholders.  The directors of this
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.
 
Section 2.4:            Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any
director from serving this corporation in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor.
 
1







 
Section 2.5:            Election and Term
of Office. Through and until immediately prior to the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, the directors shall be divided
into two classes,  designated Class I
and Class II, each consisting of one-half of the directors or as close an
approximation as possible, and each director shall serve for a term running
until the second annual meeting of shareholders succeeding his or her election
and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified;
provided, however, that the terms of all directors shall expire at the annual
meeting of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000. Commencing at the
annual meeting of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, each director
shall be elected to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the
following fiscal year or until his or her successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified.
 
Section 2.6:            Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director
is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at
that meeting.  The Board of Directors
may declare vacant the office of a director if he or she is declared of unsound
mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after
notice of his or her election, he or she does not accept the office.  Any vacancy, except for a vacancy created by
removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may be filled by a
person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.  Vacancies occurring in the Board of
Directors by reason of removal of directors shall be filled only by approval of
shareholders.  The shareholders may
elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the
directors.  Any such election by written
consent requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote.  If, after the filling of any
vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been elected by
the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the directors then in
office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more of the total number
of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors
may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held to elect the entire Board
of Directors.  The term of office of any
director shall terminate upon such election of a successor.  Any director may resign effective upon
giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of this
corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of
such resignation.  If the resignation is
effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the
resignation becomes effective.  A
reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director
prior to the expiration of such directors term of office.
 
Section
2.7:            Removal. The
entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without
cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is
removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not
consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such
director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be
voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were
cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to
vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent
annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom
removal is being sought, were then being elected.  If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be
elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class
or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority
granted by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of
this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the
vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.
 
Section 2.8:            Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or extent of
the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of Directors pursuant
to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that the Board of
Directors shall have full power with respect to the following matters:
 
2

(k)           To
fix a time in the future, which shall not be more than 60 days nor less
than 10 days prior to the date of the meeting nor more than sixty (60) days
prior to any other action for which it is fixed, as a record date for the
determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any
meeting, or entitled to receive any payment of any dividend or other
distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any other lawful action; and in such case only shareholders of
record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the
meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights or to
exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any
shares on the books of this corporation after any record date fixed as
aforesaid.  The Board of Directors may
close the books of this corporation against transfers of shares during the
whole or any part of such period.
 
(l)            To
fix and locate from time to time the principal office for the transaction of
the business of this corporation and one or more branch or other subordinate

from time to time and at any time these By-Laws and any and all amendments
thereof.
 
(o)           To

mortgages, pledges, hypothecations, or other evidences of debt and securities

corporation, signed officially by any officer or officers thereunto duly
authorized by the Board of Directors shall be binding on this corporation.
 
(p)           To

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS
 
Section 10.1:          Place of Meetings.  Meetings (whether regular, special or
adjourned) of the shareholders of this corporation shall be held at the
principal executive office for the transaction of business of this corporation,
or at any place within or without the State which may be designated by
written consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, or which may
be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Any meeting shall be valid wherever held if
held by the written consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,
given either before or after the meeting and filed with the Secretary of this
corporation.
 
Section 10.2:          Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall
be held at the hour of 10:00 a.m. on the last Wednesday in January in each year
, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next succeeding
business day not a legal holiday or at such other time in a particular year as
may be designated by written consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote
thereat or which may be designated by resolution of the Board of
Directors.  Such annual meetings shall
be held at the place provided pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof.  Said annual meetings shall be held for the
purpose of the election of directors, for the making of reports of the affairs
of this corporation and for the transaction of such other business as may come
before the meeting.
 
Section 10.3:          Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders for any
purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time by the President or by
the Board of Directors, or by two or more members thereof, or by one or more
holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of the votes
on the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8.  Upon request in writing sent by registered
mail to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice President or Secretary, or
delivered to any such officer in person, by any person or persons entitled to
call a special meeting of shareholders (such request, if sent by a shareholder
or shareholders, to include the information required by Section 10.13), it
shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the immediately succeeding
sentence, to cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that
a meeting will be requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, the
date of which meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less than
35 days nor more than 60 days after such request or, if applicable,
determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the immediately
succeeding sentence.  Within seven days
after receiving such a written request from a shareholder or shareholders of
the corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine whether shareholders
owning not less than ten percent (10%) of the shares as of the record date
established pursuant to Section 10.8 for such request support the call of a
special meeting and notify the requesting party or parties of its finding.
 
Section 10.4:          Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting of shareholders shall
be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of
the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that duty, or if there be no
such officer or person, or in case of his or her neglect or refusal, by any
director or shareholder.  The notice
shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a
special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no
other business may be transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting,
those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the
notice, intends to present for action by the shareholders, but any proper
matter may be presented at the meeting for such action except that notice must
be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to approval of contracts
between the corporation and any director of this corporation, amendment of the
Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or winding up of
this corporation.  The notice of any
meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of
nominees intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for
election.  Written notice shall be given
by this corporation to any shareholder, either (i) personally or (ii) by mail
or other means of 
 
11







 
written communication, charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder
at such shareholders address appearing on the books of this corporation or
given by such shareholder to this corporation for the purpose of notice.  If a shareholder gives no address or no such
address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be deemed to
have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication
addressed to the place where the principal executive office of this corporation
is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the county in which such office is located. 
The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered
personally or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by
other means of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore
provided.  An affidavit of delivery or
mailing of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4,
executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be
prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice.  If any notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such
shareholder appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to this
corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the
United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder
at such address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given
without further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon
written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of this corporation
for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice to all other
shareholders.
 
Section 10.5:          Consent to
Shareholders Meetings.  The
transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and
wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if,
either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote,
not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a
consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes
thereof.  All such waivers, consents or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes
of the meeting.  Attendance of a person
at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when
the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the
consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not
so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor
the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified
in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of contracts between
this corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or winding up the affairs of
this corporation.
 
Section 10.6:          Quorum.  The presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Shares shall not be counted to make up a
quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the meeting has been enjoined
or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business
until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
 
Section 10.7:          Adjourned Meetings.  Any shareholders meeting, whether or not a
quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority
of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented
by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, in the
absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45
days or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder
of record entitled to vote at a meeting. 
Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of the
time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted
thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is
taken.  At any adjourned meeting the
shareholders may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.
 
12







 
Section 10.8:          Voting Rights.  Only persons in whose names shares entitled
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of business
on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed for the
determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) hereof, then
on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.  In the absence of any contrary provision in
the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable statute relating to the
election of directors or to other particular matters, each such person shall be
entitled to one vote for each share.
 
In order that the corporation may determine the
shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting or request a special meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section
10.3, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14)
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors.  Any
shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the
shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice to the
Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but
in no event later than twenty eight (28) days after the date on which such
request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.
 
Section 10.9:          Action by Written
Consents.  Any action which may be
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted.  Within fourteen (14)
days after receiving such written consent or consents from shareholders of the
corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of
outstanding shares as of the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8
having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted have properly consented thereto in writing and
notify the requesting party of its finding. 
Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been
solicited in writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts
between this corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any
person, (iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to
shareholders upon winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given at
least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by such
approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other corporate
action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not consented in
writing.  All notices given hereunder
shall conform to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable
law.  When written consents are given
with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from the
persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation at
the time such respective consents are given, or any shareholders proxy holder,
or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder
or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received
by this corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of
shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the
Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation is effective upon its
receipt by the Secretary of this corporation. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected
by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled
to vote for the election of directors.
 
Section
10.10: Elections of Directors. In any election of
directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of
the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be
elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes
withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal
effect.  Elections of 
 
13







 
directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a
shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.
 
Section 10.11:
Proxies.  Every person entitled
to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or
by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or
such persons duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this
corporation.  No proxy shall be valid
(l) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable
and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and applicable law, or (2) after
the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless the person
executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to
continue in force.  Revocation may be
effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating
that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by
attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the
proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the
death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written
notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy which states that it is irrevocable
is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following
or a nominee of any of the following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who has
purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a
person who has sold a portion of such persons shares in this corporation to
the maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or the
shareholder who extended or continued credit to this corporation or the
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given
in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of
the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has contracted
to perform services as an employee of this corporation, if a proxy is required
by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in
consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the
period of employment contracted for, (5) a person designated by or under a
close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable
if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title,
either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms,
discharge the obligation secured by it. 
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy
becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to
purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of this
corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is paid,
the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding
a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge
of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its
irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares.  Every form of proxy or written consent,
which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect
to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked abstain,
whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her
shares on the proposal.  A proxy marked
abstain by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be
voted either for or against such proposal. 
In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors
to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a
shareholder withhold or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the
authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted
either for or against the election of a director.
 
Section 10.12:
Inspectors of Election.  Before
any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons
other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting
or its adjournment.  If no inspectors of
election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request
of any shareholder or a shareholders proxy shall, appoint inspectors of
election at the meeting.  The number of
inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or
more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their
proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (l) or three (3)
inspectors are to be appointed.  If any
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the
Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a
shareholders proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
 
14







 
These inspectors shall:
 
(a)           Determine
the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity,
validity, and effect of proxies;
 
(b)           Receive
votes, ballots, or consents;
 
(c)           Hear
and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with
the right to vote;
 
(d)           Count
and tabulate all votes or consents;
 
(e)           Determine
when the polls shall close;
 
(f)            Determine
the result; and
 
(g)           Do
any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness
to all shareholders.
 
Section 10.13:  Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals
and Director Nominations. 
Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as directors
at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before a meeting
of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely notice in
proper written form of such shareholders intent to make such nomination or
nominations or to propose such business. 
To be timely, a shareholders notice must be received by the Secretary
of the Corporation not later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided,
however, that in the event less than 70 days notice or prior public disclosure
of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the
shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be in proper written form a shareholders
notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the
shareholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as
the case may be, of the person or persons to be nominated or of the business to
be proposed, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record
of stock of the Corporation that intends to vote such stock at such meeting
and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) if applicable, a
description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and
each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such person or persons)
pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the
shareholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee or each matter
of business to be proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by

meeting.

shall be held after the adjournment of each annual meeting of the shareholders
(which regular directors meeting shall be designated the Regular Annual
Meeting) and at such other times as may be designated from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Directors. 
Notice of the time and place of all regular meetings shall be given in
the same manner as for special meetings, except that no such notice need be given
if (l) the time and place of such meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors

provided at Section 1.1 hereof and on the date specified in Section 10.2
hereof.

Meetings.  Special meetings of the
Board of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days notice by mail or
48 hours notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each
director.  Notice need not be given to
any director who signs a waiver of notice or who attends the meeting without
protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such
director.  Any oral notice given
personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.  A notice or waiver of notice need not
specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board.  If the address of a director is not shown on the records and
is not readily ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or
place in which the meetings of the directors are regularly held.  If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24
hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior

majority of all directors elected by the shareholders and appointed to fill
vacancies as provided in Section 2.6 hereof shall constitute a quorum of the

present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the
Board of Directors subject to (a) provisions of law relating to interested
directors, (b) indemnification of agents of this corporation and (c) Section
12.9 hereof.  A majority of the
directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting
to another time and place.  A meeting at
which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business
notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by
at least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting.
 
Section 11.6:          Conference Telephone.  Members of the Board of Directors may
participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in such
meeting can hear one another. 
Participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 11.6 constitutes
presence in person at such meeting.
 
Section 11.7:          Waiver of Notice and
Consent.  The transactions of any
meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held,
shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and
notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting,
each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent
to holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents and approvals
shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the
meeting.
 
Section 11.8:          Action Without a
Meeting.  Any action required or
permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting,
if all members of the Board of 
 
16







 
Directors shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such
action.  Such written consent or
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of
Directors. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect
as the unanimous vote of such directors.
 
Section 11.9:          Committees.  The provisions of this Article XI apply also
to committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees, mutatis
mutandis.

Writing.  All checks, drafts,
demands for money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of
this corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents,
as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or employee of this
corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by contract or
otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the Board of
Directors.
 
Section 12.2:          Shares Held by the
Corporation.  Shares in other
corporations standing in the name of this corporation may be voted or
represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the
corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do by
resolution of the Board of Directors.
 
Section 12.3:          Certificates of Stock.  There shall be issued to every holder of
shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates signed in the name of
this corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the
Chief Executive Officer or the President or a Vice President and by the Chief
Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary or
any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or
series of shares owned by the shareholder. 
Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or
registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by this corporation with
the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar
at the date of issue.
 
Section 12.4:          Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate for
shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original
certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation has notice
that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, (2)
files with this corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such amount
as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice
President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies any other reasonable
requirements imposed by this corporation. 
The Board of Directors may adopt such other provisions and restrictions
with reference to lost certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as
it shall in its discretion deem appropriate.
 
Section 12.5:          Certification and
Inspection of By-Laws.  This
corporation shall keep at its principal executive or business office the
original or a copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise altered to date,
which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times
during office hours.
 
Section 12.6:          Annual Reports.  The making of annual reports to the
shareholders is dispensed with and the requirement that such annual reports be
made to shareholders is expressly waived, except as may be directed from time
to time by the Board of Directors or the President.
 
Section 12.7:          Fiscal Quarters.
Each fiscal quarter of the Corporation shall be comprised of 13 weeks each of
which shall end at midnight on Saturday of such week, and the fiscal months in
any one calendar quarter shall be comprised of at least four consecutive
calendar weeks with one week to be added, at managements discretion, to any
one month during such fiscal year.
 
Section 12.8:          Officer Loans and
Guaranties.  If the corporation has
outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons on the date of
approval by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money or
property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer 
 
18







 
of the corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the
officer is a director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone.  Such approval by the Board of Directors must
be determined by a vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, if it is
determined that such a loan or guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit
the corporation.  In no event may an
officer owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation
be extended a loan under this provision.
 
Section 12.9:          Approval of Certain
Transactions.  In addition to
Section 11.5. Quorum hereof, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
disinterested outside directors shall be required to (a) approve any merger or
acquisition transaction for which the approval of the Companys shareholders is
necessary for consummation of the transaction and (b) .approve or ratify any

WITH
REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS
OF LAW
 
Section 13.1:          By-Law Provisions
Additional and Supplemental to Provisions of Law.  All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions
of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and
additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof
and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law
unless such compliance shall be illegal.
 
Section 13.2:          By-Law Provisions

or inconsistent with any applicable provision of law, shall not apply so long
as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not
affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it
being hereby declared that these By-Laws, and each article, section,
subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase thereof, would have been
adopted irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections,

or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted
by the shareholders; provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the
Articles of Incorporation reducing the number or the minimum number of

adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws, By-Laws, other than a By-Law or amendment

minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa, may
be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of 
 
19







 
Directors. A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or
eliminate the power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal
By-Laws.

limiting or restricting the rights of any one or more of them to sell, assign,
transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or transfer on the books of this
corporation any or all of the shares of this corporation held by them, and if a
copy of said agreement shall be filed with this corporation, or if (b)
shareholders entitled to vote shall adopt any By-Law provision abridging,
limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, then, and in
either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such
abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference thereto
endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such certificates shall
not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation except in
accordance with the terms and provisions of such agreement or ByLaw, as the
case may be; provided, that no restriction shall be binding with respect to
shares issued prior to adoption of the restriction unless the holders of such
shares voted in favor of or consented in writing to the restriction.
 
 
Article XVI
 
INDEMNIFICATION OF
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER
AGENTS
 
Section 16.1:          Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  The corporation shall, to the maximum extent
and in the manner permitted by the Code, indemnify each of its directors and
officers against expenses (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code),
judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the
Code), arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the
corporation.  For purposes of this
Article XVI, a director or officer of the corporation includes any person
(i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii)
who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor
corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such
predecessor corporation.
 
Section 16.2:          Indemnification of
Others.  The corporation shall have
the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Code, to indemnify
each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against
expenses (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines,
settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection
with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this Article XVI, an
employee or agent of the corporation (other than a director or officer)
includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii)
who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor
corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such
predecessor corporation.
 
Section 16.3:          Payment of Expenses
in Advance.  Expenses incurred in
defending any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification
is required pursuant to Section 16.1 
 
20







 
or for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 16.2
following authorization thereof by the Board of Directors, shall be paid by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnified
party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article XVI.
 
Section 16.4:          Indemnity Not
Exclusive.  The indemnification
provided by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to
indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.
 
Section 16.5:          Insurance
Indemnification.  The corporation
shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted
against or incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of such
persons status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.
 
Section 16.6:          Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is
mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:
 
(a)           That
it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles of Incorporation,
these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an agreement in effect at the
time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in the
proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
 
(b)           That
it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in
approving a settlement.
