APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
 
Apple Computer, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal computers
and related software, peripherals and personal computing and communicating
solutions. The Companys products include the Macintosh line of desktop and
notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music
player, and a portfolio of software products and peripherals for education,
creative, consumer and business customers. The Company sells its products
through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and
resellers, and its own retail stores.
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Interim information is unaudited;
however, in the opinion of the Companys management, all adjustments of a
normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of interim periods
presented have been included.  The
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
for the entire year.  Certain prior year
amounts in these condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003, included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2003 (the 2003 Form
10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters
refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters of those fiscal years.
 
Research and Development
Research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold,
leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a
products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a
product is available for general release to customers pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased,
or Otherwise Marketed. In most instances, the Companys products are
released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore,
costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are
usually not significant, and generally all software development costs have been
expensed.
 
During the second
quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated
with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and
prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004.
Therefore, during the second quarter of 2004, the Company capitalized
approximately $2.3 million of costs associated with the development of
FileMaker Pro 7.  In accordance with
SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset began in March 2004 when FileMaker Pro
7 was shipped and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year
estimated useful life.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company
measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company
applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation  Transition and Disclosure as if the fair value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has
elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No.
25, when the exercise
 
5







 
price of the
Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
 
As required under
SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income
and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee
stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant
and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options
vesting period and the shares plan period.
 
The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Companys
expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options
and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly
different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of
the fair value of the Companys employee stock options and employee stock
purchase plan shares.

information for the three and six month periods ended March 27, 2004 and March

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per
common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of
additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect
of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted stock units is
reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
method.  Under the treasury stock
method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock may
result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, restricted stock
and restricted stock units.

six months ended March 27, 2004, and March 29, 2003, respectively, were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods
because their effect would have been antidilutive.

The Companys short-term
investment portfolio consists of investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency
securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign securities. The Companys
U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of commercial
 
7







 
paper, certificates of deposit,
time deposits, and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist
primarily of foreign commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time
deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S.
dollars. The Company had net unrealized gains of $500,000 as of March 27, 2004
and net unrealized losses of $1 million as of September 27, 2003, on its
investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities
greater than 1 year. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments
prior to their stated maturities. The Company recognized no net gains or losses
during the three and six month periods ended March 27, 2004 and recognized net gains
of $9 million and $18 million during the three and six month periods ended
March 29, 2003. These net gains were included in interest and other income,
net.
 
As of March 27, 2004, and
September 27, 2003, $810 million and $629 million, respectively, of the
Companys investment portfolio that was classified as short-term investments
had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. 
The remainder of the Companys short-term investments had underlying
maturities between 3 and 12 months.
 
Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments and
Related Gains
The Company has held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),
Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc.
(EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other assets and have
been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the
sale of these investments have been included in interest and other income.
 
During the first quarter of
2004, the Company sold all of its remaining non-current investments in public
companies, consisting of 986,164 shares of Akamai for net proceeds of
approximately $5 million, and a gain before taxes of $4 million.
 
During the first quarter of
2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of
approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Companys carrying
value of the shares. No sales of the Companys non-current debt and equity
investments were made in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Debt
The Company had debt
outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5%
unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994 and were repaid upon their
maturity in February 2004. The notes, which paid interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.
 
Derivative Financial
Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to
partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate
risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to offset the
foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge
the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted
revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the Company enters into interest
rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate profile of certain investments
and debt. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on
whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The
Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  As of the end of the second quarter of 2004,
the general nature of the Companys risk management activities and the general
nature and mix of the Companys derivative financial instruments have not
changed materially from the end of fiscal 2003.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain
probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign
exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost
of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging
instruments.
 
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company has
historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
any outstanding long-term debt, and/or
 
8







 
to diversify a
portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S.
interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that
are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management
program.  The Company does not hold or
transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.
 
Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for all
derivatives at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair
value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in
fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. As of March 27, 2004, the Company had a net deferred
loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $2 million net of taxes,
substantially all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the
end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Note 4  Restructuring Actions
 
2004 Restructuring Actions
During the second
quarter of 2004, the Companys management approved restructuring actions that
resulted in the recognition of a total restructuring charge of $9.6
million.  These actions were related to
the closing of the
Companys Sacramento manufacturing operations within the Americas operating
segment and headcount reductions related primarily to various sales and
marketing activities in the Companys Americas and Europe operating
segments.  These restructuring actions
will ultimately result in the termination of 348 positions, 69 of which had
been terminated prior to the end of the second quarter of 2004.
 
The approved plan to cease manufacturing operations in Sacramento
resulted in severance for 200 employees at a cost of $1.9 million, which is
expected to be paid during the third quarter of 2004. The Company recognized a
charge related primarily to restructuring actions associated with sales and marketing
activities in the United States and Europe for employee severance costs of $7.7
million, the majority of which will be paid before the end of fiscal year 2004,
for the termination of 148 positions.
 
The following
table summarizes activity associated with employee severance costs resulting
from the restructuring actions initiated during fiscal year 2004 (in millions):

2003 Restructuring Actions
The Company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during the
year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in
severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1
million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations.
 
During the third
quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally accrued for
lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the sublease of a
property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately $500,000
shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than expected
severance costs related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had a net neutral effect on reported operating
expense.
 
During the second
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8
million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and
 
10







 
$400,000 for asset
write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the
second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the
prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales
and marketing functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the
Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease
payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions will ultimately
result in the elimination of 93 positions worldwide, all but one of which were
eliminated by the end of the second quarter of 2004.
 
During the first quarter of
2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring actions
with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of
manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further
reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product
strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various
sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These
restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260 positions worldwide.
 
Closure of the Companys
Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of $1.8 million
and costs of $6.7 million to write off manufacturing related fixed assets,
whose use ceased during the first quarter of 2003. PowerSchool related costs
included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of
previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired
by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who
were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and
marketing activities and employees, principally in the United States and
Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs
associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The
total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first
quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring
accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.
 
Of the $26.8 million, nearly
all had been spent by the end of the second quarter of 2004, except for
approximately $200,000 of severance costs and approximately $4 million related
to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. The Company currently
anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of
approximately $200,000 will be spent in fiscal 2004 and the remaining accrual
for operating lease costs will be paid over the remaining lease terms.

Note 5  Shareholders Equity
 
Restricted Stock Units
On March 24, 2004,
the Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 2.4 million restricted
stock units to selected members of the Companys senior management, excluding
its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
These restricted stock units generally vest in two equal installments on
the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.  The Company has recorded the $61.2 million
value of these restricted stock units as a component of shareholders equity
and will amortize that amount on a straight-line basis over the 4 year
requisite service period. The value of the restricted stock units was based on
the closing market price of the Companys common stock of $25.50 on the date of
grant. Quarterly amortization will be approximately $3.8 million, of which
approximately $0.5 million will be included in cost of sales; $1.1 million will
be included in research and development expense; and the
 
11







 
remaining $2.2
million will be included in selling, general and administrative expense. The
restricted stock units will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings
per share utilizing the treasury stock method.
 
CEO Restricted Stock Award
On March 19, 2003, the Company
entered into an Option Cancellation and Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the
Agreement) with Mr. Steven P. Jobs, its CEO. 
The Agreement cancelled stock option awards for the purchase of 27.5
million shares of the Companys common stock previously granted to Mr. Jobs in
2000 and 2001. Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase 60,000 shares of the
Companys common stock granted in August of 1997 in his capacity as a member of
the Companys Board of Directors, prior to becoming the Companys CEO.  The Agreement replaced the cancelled options
with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the Companys common
stock.  The restricted stock award
generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or all of the
restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is terminated
without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a change in
control of the Company.
 
The Company has
recorded the value of the restricted stock award of $74.75 million as a
component of shareholders equity and is amortizing that amount on a
straight-line basis over the 3 year service/vesting period.  The value of the restricted stock award was
based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock of $14.95 on
the date of the award. Amortization expense for this award, which amounts to
approximately $6.2 million per quarter, has been included in selling, general,
and administrative expense beginning in March 2003 and will continue to be
included through March 2006.  The 5
million restricted shares have been included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method.
 
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists
of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 6  Employee Benefit Plans
 
2003 Employee Stock Option Plan
At the Annual
Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an
amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for
broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other
key employees and to prohibit future repricings of employee stock options,
including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder
approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under
the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally
become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment,
with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.
 
1997 Employee Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder
approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of
the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under
the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally
become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment,
with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of
amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company
terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all remaining
unissued shares totaling 14,295,351 following the completion of an employee
stock option exchange program in October 2003.
 
Employee Stock Option Exchange Program
On March 20, 2003, the Company
announced a voluntary employee stock option exchange program (the Exchange
Program) whereby eligible employees, other than executive officers and members
of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options
with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller
number of new stock options issued with exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of one share of the Companys common stock on the day the new
awards are issued, which will be at least six months plus one day after the
exchange options are cancelled.  On
April 17, 2003, in accordance with the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled
options to purchase 16,569,193 shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003,
new stock options totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an
exercise price of $22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of
the Companys stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated
with this transaction.
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a shareholder approved Director Stock
Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee directors of the Company. Initial grants of
30,000 options under the DSOP vest in three equal installments on each of the
first through third anniversaries of the date of grant, and subsequent annual
grants of 10,000 options are fully vested at grant.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain of the Companys
executive officers, including Mr. Fred D. Anderson, Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr.
Jonathan Rubinstein, and Mr. Bertrand Serlet, have entered into trading plans
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts,
prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of
future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the exercise and
sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys
employee stock purchase plan.
 
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum
of $25,000 in any calendar year. As of March 27, 2004, approximately 3 million
shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. The number of
shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per
offering period.

The Company had 2.4 million
restricted stock units outstanding as of March 27, 2004, which were excluded
from the options outstanding balances in the preceding tables.  None of these restricted stock units were
vested as of March 27, 2004. The grant of these restricted stock units has been
deducted from the shares available for grant under the Companys stock option
plans.
 
Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has
provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per
share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been
used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan
purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model.
 
For purposes of
the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards
issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the Employee Stock
Option Exchange Program have been accounted for using modification
accounting.  In accordance with SFAS No.
123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date of acceptance of the
exchange offer by participating employees. The cancellation of certain of the
Companys Chief Executive Officers options and replacement with restricted
shares in March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting
for purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.
 
The assumptions
used for the three and six month periods ended March 27, 2004 and March 29,
2003, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of

Note 8  Commitments and
Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The Company leases
various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable
operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are for
terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to
5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 15 years and
often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2003, the
Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases were $600 million, of which $354 million related to leases for retail
space.  As of March 27, 2004, total future
minimum lease payments related to leases for retail space increased to $376
million.
 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The Company offers a basic
limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty
period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by
the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day
 
15







 
basic warranty for Apple
software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products.
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product
warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject
to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company
assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the
amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future
expectations.
 
The following table reconciles
changes in the Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three and
six month periods ended March 27, 2004 and March 29, 2003 (in millions):

The Company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application
software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party
intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement
costs as of either March 27, 2004 or September 27, 2003.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September 27,
2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and
purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys publicly
traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000.
The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek
unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these
claims are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company
filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on
September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the
Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave
to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard
the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims
with prejudice on August 12, 2003.  Plaintiffs have appealed the
ruling.
 
The Company is subject to
certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement
to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful
life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling
with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in
several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various European
Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S.  Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations
and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
operations and financial position.

Note 9 - Segment Information and Geographic
Data
 
In accordance with
SFAS No 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
the Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.
 
The Company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the
Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as
well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Retail segment
currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and Japan.
Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and
Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K in
Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, except as described below
for the Retail segment.
 
The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segments
performance is also evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are based on the location of the customers. Operating
income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating
income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses
that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment
operating income include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not
included in standard costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges.
Corporate expenses include research and development, corporate marketing
expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses including
certain corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The
Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets
include cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to
depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital
expenditures by the Retail segment were $20 million and $24 million during the
second quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $48 million and $30 million
during the first six months of 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Operating income for all
segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing standard cost,
other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and certain general and
administrative costs. This measure of operating income, which includes
manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison between the
Companys various geographic segments. 
Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments not included in
segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and actual
manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product supplied to
the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.
 
Management assesses the
operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it assesses the
operating performance of the Companys geographic segments. The Retail segment
revenue and operating income is intended to depict a comparable measure to that
of the Companys major channel partners in the United States operating retail
stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment performance as if it were
a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three significant adjustments
to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes that are not included
in the results of the Companys other segments.
 
First, the Retail segments
operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products at an amount
normally charged to major channel partners in the United States operating
retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those
channel partners and the Companys cost to support those partners. For the
second quarter of 2004 and 2003, this resulted in the recognition of additional
cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting
benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $45 million and $23 million,
respectively. For the first six months of 2004 and 2003, this resulted in the
recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail
segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $97
million and $46 million, respectively.
 
17







 
Second, the Companys extended
warranty, support and service contracts are transferred to the Retail segment
at the same cost as that charged to the Companys major retail channel partners
in the United States, resulting in a comparable measure of revenue and gross
margin between the Companys Retail stores and those retail channel partners.  The Retail segment recognizes the full
amount of revenue and cost of sales at the time of sale of the Companys
extended warranty, support and service contracts. Because the Company has not
yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these
contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating
segments net sales and cost of sales. For the second quarter of 2004, this
resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail
segment, with corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $12 million
and $8 million, respectively. For the second quarter of 2003, the net sales and
cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended warranty,
support and service contracts were $6 million and $4 million, respectively. For
the first six months of 2004, this resulted in the recognition of additional
net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets
in other operating segments, of $24 million and $16 million, respectively. This
compares to similar adjustments to net sales and cost of sales during the first
six months of 2003 of $12 million and $9 million, respectively.
 
Third, the Company has opened
five high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and
Tokyo, Japan as of March 27, 2004 and has two additional stores under
development in Osaka, Japan, and London, England, which are expected to open by
the end of calendar year 2004.  These
high profile stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and
were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for
certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate
briefings.  As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the excess amount incurred for
a high profile store to that of a more typical Company retail location.
Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of
these stores were $4.0 million and $1.1 million in the second quarters of 2004
and 2003, respectively, and $6.2 million and $2.2 million for the first six
months of 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 10  Related Party Transactions and
Certain Other Transactions
 
In March 2002, the Company
entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr.
Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the
operation of his private plane when used for Apple business.  The Reimbursement Agreement became effective
for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took
delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $40,000
and $77,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the
second quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $322,000 and $161,000 in
expenses for the first six months of 2004 and 2003. All expenses recognized
pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations.
 
In connection with a relocation
assistance package, the Company in May 2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson,
Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5 million for the purchase of his principal
residence. The loan was secured by a deed of trust and was due and payable in
May 2004. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should
he exercise any of his stock options prior to the due date of the loan, he
would pay the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (1) an amount equal
to 50% of the total net gain realized from the exercise of the options; or
(2) $375,000 multiplied by the number of years between the exercise date
and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid $750,000 of this loan in fiscal
2003 and repaid the remaining balance of $750,000 in April 2004.
 
Mr. Jerome York, a member
of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group
that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000.
Until September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software
and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On September
8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American assets of
MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in the United States. MicroWarehouse accounted for 0.3% and 0.4% of
the Companys net sales for the three and six month periods ended March 27,
2004, respectively; and 2.8% and 3.0% of the Companys net sales for the three
and six month periods ended March 29, 2003, respectively. Trade receivables
from MicroWarehouse were $9.3 million and $9.9 million as of March 27, 2004 and
September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to
be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Companys
secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected
payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade
receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those
with the Companys other resellers. In addition, the Company has purchased
miscellaneous equipment and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases
amounted to approximately $385,000 and $1.2 million for the three and six month
periods ended March 29, 2003. No purchases were made in the three or six months
ended March 27, 2004.

Executive Overview
Apple designs, manufactures and
markets personal computers and related software and services, peripherals and
personal computing and communicating solutions. The Company sells its products
worldwide through its online stores, direct sales force, third-party
wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail stores. The Companys products
and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the
Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital music player, the iTunes Music
Store and digital music management software, and a portfolio of other software
products, peripherals and services for education, creative, consumer and
business customers.  A further
description of the Companys products may be found below and in Part I, Item 1
of the 2003 Form 10-K under the heading Business.
 
The Company competes in several
highly competitive markets including the personal computer industry with its
Macintosh line of computers and related software, the consumer electronics
industry with products such as the iPod, and digital music distribution through
its iTunes Music Store. The Company continually faces both aggressive pricing
practices as well as the emergence of new competitors in these markets.  In an effort to remain competitive in these
markets, the Company intends to continue focusing on creating innovative
products and services aligned with its digital hub strategy, whereby the
Macintosh functions as the digital hub for digital devices including the iPod,
personal digital assistants, cellular phones, digital video and still cameras,
and other electronic devices.  The
Company is also concentrating on expanding and improving its distribution
capabilities by opening its own retail stores, both domestically and
internationally, in high traffic quality shopping venues; staffing selected
resellers stores with Company employees; entering into strategic alliances
with other companies to brand and sell the Companys products and services;
increasing the accessibility of iPods through various resellers that do not
currently sell Macintosh systems; and increasing the reach of its online
stores.
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and results of operations requires the Companys management to make
judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K describes
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
 
20







 
which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.
 
Management believes the
Companys critical accounting estimates are those related to revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and exposures
related to inventory purchase commitments, valuation of long-lived assets
including acquired intangibles, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management
believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and they require
management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently
uncertain.
 
Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist primarily of
revenue from the sale of products (i.e., hardware, software, and peripherals),
and extended warranty and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue
pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position
(SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue
Recognition.
 
The Company
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is
probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been
shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred.  For most of the Companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.  For online sales to individuals, for some
sales to education customers in the United States, and for certain other sales,
the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the
Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during
transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the
arrangement fee is not, or is presumed to not be, fixed and determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and
payable.
 
The Company records reductions
to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for
customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other
sales programs and volume-based incentives. 
The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to
revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a
plan.  The Company also records
reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product
transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and
incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional
reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally,
certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of
customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience
and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a
greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the
Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which
could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company distributes its
products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education,
consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt
to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain
customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia and by arranging with third-party
financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease
programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements
are directly between the third-party financing company and the end
customer.  As such, the Company does not
assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these
arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners.
 
The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific
customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and
financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an
allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably
believed to be collectible.  The Company
also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple
factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic
environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels,
and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major
customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional
information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future
actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those
currently
 
21







 
anticipated, the Company may
have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings
in the period the adjustments are made.
 
Inventory
Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments
The Company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and
products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become
obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The
Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers
multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product
development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The
personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of
product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or
market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted
or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of
component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional
write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the
write-downs are recorded.
 
The Company accrues necessary
reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been
cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components
through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open
orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover
the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is
an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys
products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of
the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional
reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in
the period when the cancellation fees are identified.
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including
Acquired Intangibles
The Company reviews property,
plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is
measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash
flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related
to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the
past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring
actions, deterioration in the Companys business in a geographic region or
business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of
individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in future
periods in which such business issues are identified.
 
In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of
goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential
impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly
subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting
units of the Companys business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate
the fair value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3)
the Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated
fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less
than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of
all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner
similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires
independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets
including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once
this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be
determined.
 
Based on the Companys
estimates as of March 27, 2004, there was no impairment of goodwill. However,
changes in various circumstances including changes in the Companys market
capitalization, changes in the Companys forecasts, and changes in the
Companys internal business structure could cause one or more of the Companys
reporting units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of
goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer
industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may
strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or
otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property,
plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill.
 
Warranty Costs
The Company provides currently
for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue
is recognized based on the size of the installed base of products subject to
warranty protection, historical and projected
 
22







 
warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter,
the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.  If actual product failure rates or repair
costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability
would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of
operations.
 
Income Taxes
The Company records a tax
provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of
operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.
 
Management believes it is more
likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated
as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects
of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the
remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an
adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the
period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes
deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the
respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive
adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such
determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves
significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. 
Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements
expectations could have a material impact on the Companys results of
operations and financial position.

Net sales during the second quarter of 2004 increased 29% or $434
million from the same quarter in 2003, and were up 33% or $968 million for the
first six months of fiscal 2004 compared to the same period of fiscal
2003.  Several factors contributed to
these increases including:
 
                  Net sales of peripherals
and other hardware rose $320 million or 148% during the second quarter of 2004
compared to the same quarter in 2003, and increased $601 million or 138% in the
first half of 2004. These increases in the second quarter of 2004 result
primarily from the significant year-over-year increase in iPod net sales and
unit sales of 752% and 909%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004
compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  Strong iPod sales were experienced in all of the Companys
operating segments during the second quarter of 2004 with unit sales of
807,000, surpassing record units sales in the prior holiday quarter by 10%. In
addition, iPod sales during the current year were favorably affected by several
factors including shipment of the iPod mini which began in the second quarter
of 2004; the introduction of Macintosh and Windows compatible models; the
Companys introduction of a new version of the iTunes Music Store in the U.S.
for both Macintosh and Windows users in October 2003; and expansion of the
Companys iPod distribution network. Net sales of peripherals and other
hardware was also favorably affected by an increase in net sales of displays
and other computer accessories, which rose by 47% and 60% for the three and six
months ended March 27, 2004, compared to the same periods in 2003,
respectively.  Net sales of other
computer accessories include, AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital
video cameras, third party hardware products, and a number of iPod related
accessories.  The increase in total net
sales of peripherals and other hardware were experienced predominantly by the
Companys Americas, Europe, and Retail segments.
 
                  Total Macintosh
net sales increased by 6% and 11% during the second quarter and first six
months of 2004 compared with the same periods in 2003.  Unit sales during these same periods also
reflected similar increases of 5% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same
period in the prior year. Unit sales of the Companys professional desktop and
portable systems for the first half of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003
increased 21% and 32%, respectively. The increase in year-to-date Power
Macintosh sales is due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which
did not begin shipping until the end of fiscal 2003. In addition, iBook unit
sales increased 26% in the first half of 2004 compared to the same period in
the prior year. Unit sales of portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and
iBook, represented 48% of all Macintosh systems sold during the three and six
months ended March 27, 2004 and increased by 20% and 29% during the second
quarter and first half of the prior year, respectively, which reflects an
overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Net sales per Macintosh
unit sold during the second quarter of 2004 remained relatively flat compared
to the same quarter in 2003, but increased 2% to $1,539 during the first six
months of 2004 from $1,512 in 2003.  The
year to date increase was the result of various changes in overall unit mix
towards relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems and an
increase in direct sales primarily from the Companys retail and online stores.
The impact of these factors was somewhat offset by lower year-over-year pricing
for the first half of 2004 on comparable Macintosh systems for some of the
Companys Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure.
 
                  The Retail
segments net sales grew 97% to $266 million during the second quarter of 2004
and grew by 90% to $539 million in the first half of the year compared to the
same periods in the prior year.  These
increases are largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 53 at
the end of the second quarter of 2003 to 78 as of March 27, 2004, as well as a
35% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys
customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to
purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting
sales channels in the United States and Japan, the Company believes that a
substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is incremental to the
Companys total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail
segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
                  Net sales of
software rose $32 million or 34% during the second quarter of 2004 compared to
the same quarter in 2003, and increased $93 million or 51% for the first six
months of 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases
reflect higher net sales of Apple-branded software including iLife, which was
introduced in January 2004, and Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther, which was
released in October 2003 and accounted for approximately $13 million and $65
million of the increase in software net sales for the three and six month
periods ended March 27, 2004, respectively.
 
28







 
                  The Companys
U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of
approximately 18% during both the second quarter and first half of 2004.  Also, unit sales increased by 10% and 9% for
the three and six month periods ended March 27, 2004 compared to the same
periods in the prior year. While the K-12 market has remained relatively flat
in net sales and unit sales year-over-year, the Companys higher education
market has continued to perform well driving the Companys overall growth in
U.S. education. Sales of iBook also increased year-over-year in the second
quarter of 2004 due in part to increases in the number of one-to-one (1:1)
learning solutions whereby every student and teacher receive a computer.
 
                  Service and
other sales rose over 30% during the second quarter and for the first six
months of 2004 compared to the same periods in 2003.  These increases are the result of significant year-over-year
increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended
maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net sales associated
with Internet services. Increased net sales associated with APP are primarily
the result of higher attach rates on APP over the last several years. Increased
net sales associated with Internet services are due primarily to the
introduction of the iTunes Music Store, introduced for the Macintosh in April
of 2003 and updated in October 2003 for both Windows and Macintosh users, and
increased net sales of the Companys .Mac Internet service.
 
Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net
sales during the second quarter and first half of 2004 were negatively impacted
by the following:
 
                  Net sales and
unit sales of iMac systems were down 17% and 15%, respectively, during the
second quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003.  This same pattern of decline was also
experienced in the first six months of 2004 with decreases of 24% and 20% in
net sales and unit sales, respectively. 
Sales of flat panel iMac systems, which have a suggested retail price
starting at $1,299, have been negatively affected by a shift in consumer preference
to portable systems and competitor desktop models with price points below
$1,000.  The Company introduced a new
version of the eMac in April 2004 with a suggested retail price starting at
$799 aimed at the price sensitive customer. Also, the current flat panel iMac
and eMac form factors are approximately 2 years old, which continue to
contribute to declining net sales.
 
                  Net sales and
unit sales in the Companys Japan segment declined during both the second
quarter and first half of 2004 compared to the same periods of 2003.  These declines are believed to be
attributable to the continued weakness in consumer PC shipments throughout
Japan, the Companys belief that its professional and creative customers have delayed
computer upgrades pending the release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native
applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, and a shift in sales from the Japan
Segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of the Tokyo store in
the first quarter of 2004. See additional comments below related to the Japan
segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
Segment Operating
Performance
The Company manages its
business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating
segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America, except for the activities of the
Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as
well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment.  The Retail segment currently operates
Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and opened its first
international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys
operating segments may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment
Information and Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment grew 29% or $197 million in the
second quarter of 2004 compared with the same quarter in 2003.  For the first six months of 2004, net sales
grew $383 million, a 27% increase, compared to the same period of 2003.  The increase in net sales was primarily
attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well
as from strong sales of peripherals, software, and services.  Macintosh unit sales also increased by 7%
and 3%, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended March 27, 2004
driven primarily from strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems,
partially offset by continued weakness in iMac sales.
 
29







 
As noted above, the Company experienced an increase of approximately
18% in U.S. education channel net sales for both the quarter and six month
periods of 2004 compared to the same periods in the prior year. Strong U.S.
education net sales in the second quarter and first half of the year relate
primarily to strength in higher education net sales that drove year-over-year
growth of over 40% for both the three and six months periods ended March 27,
2004. The Companys K-12 net sales were relatively flat year-over-year, despite
the challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and
increased competition.
 
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased
$111 million or 33% during the second quarter of 2004 as compared to the same
quarter in 2003, and increased $279 million or 40% for the first six months of
2004 compared to the same period in 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe
were up 4% and 12% in the second quarter and first half of 2004 compared to the
same periods in 2003, respectively. 
Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net
sales across all product lines, except for the iMac, in the three and six month
periods ended March 27, 2004. Demand in Europe during these periods was particularly
strong for the Companys professional Macintosh systems, iPods, peripherals and
software.
 
Japan
Japans net sales decreased $47 million or 21% during the second
quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003, and decreased $29 million
or 8% for the first six months of 2004 compared to the same period in
2003.  Unit sales in Japan were down 29%
and 14% for the second quarter and first half of 2004, respectively, compared
to the same periods in the prior year. These decreases in net sales and unit
sales are believed to be attributable in part to negative growth in consumer PC
shipments that continues to be experienced throughout Japan, which has
contributed to the decrease in net sales of the Companys Macintosh systems.
The Company also believes that some professional and creative customers have
delayed upgrades to their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors
porting their applications to Mac OS X in Japan, including Quark XPress 6,
which is expected to occur later in fiscal year 2004.  In addition, such decreases may also be the result of a shift in
sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening
of the Tokyo store in the first quarter of 2004. The decrease in net sales was
partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during the three and six month
periods ended March 27, 2004. Japans net sales and Macintosh unit sales
continue to remain significantly below their historic levels.
 
Retail
The Company opened five new retail stores during the second quarter,
including its newest high profile store in San Francisco.  At the end of the second quarter of 2004,
the Company had 78 retail stores open as compared to 53 open stores at the end
of the second quarter of 2003.  The
Retail segments second quarter 2004 net sales grew by $131 million or 97% from
the same quarter in 2003.  Net sales for
the first six months of 2004 grew to $539 million from $283 million during the
same period of 2003, a 90% increase.
 
With an average of 75 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly
revenue per store increased to $3.5 million, up from $2.6 million in the
year-ago quarter. The Retail segment has contributed strongly to the increase
in net sales of peripherals and software experienced by the Company during
2004. During the first half of 2004, approximately 54% of the Retail segments
net sales came from the sale of iPods, other Apple-branded and third-party
peripherals, software and services. This compares to 42% for the Retail segment
during the first half of 2003 and 38% for the Company as a whole during the
first half of 2004.
 
In accordance with the
Companys operating segment reporting, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1
of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
at Note 9, Segment Information and Geographic Data, the Retail segment
reported profit of $5 million and $14 million during the second quarter and
first six months of 2004 as compared to losses of $3 million and $4 million
during the second quarter and first six months of 2003. This improvement is
primarily attributable to the segments year-over-year increase in average
quarterly revenue per store and the impact of opening 25 new stores.
 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure,
operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital
expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled
$290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, and totaled $48 million during the
first six months of 2004. As of March 27, 2004, the Retail segment had
approximately 1,660 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments
associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $376
million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to
terminate its Retail
 
30







 
segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect
the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a
new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly
in light of the significant investment involved, overall economic
uncertainties, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail
segments operating expenses.

27.8% and 27.2% for the three and six months ended March 27, 2004,
respectively, declined from 28.3% and 28.0% for the same periods in 2003. The
year-over-year declines in quarterly and year-to-date gross margins were
primarily due to the increase in mix towards more lower margin iPod and 1:1
iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were
transitioned during 2004, purchase order cancellation costs associated with
these G5 product transitions, and higher freight and duty costs in the current
year. Also contributing to the reduction in gross margin were higher warranty
costs on certain portable Macintosh products.

Research and Development (R&D)
R&D has
remained relatively flat with slight increases of 3% and 1% for the second
quarter and first six months of 2004, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2003 primarily due to increased R&D headcount to support
expanded R&D activities and employee salary merit increases. R&D as a
percentage of net sales decreased to 6% in both the three and six months ended
March 27, 2004 as compared to 8% in the same periods of the prior year due to
the significant increase in total net sales for the Company of 29% and 33% for
the three and six month periods, respectively. The Company continues to believe
that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and
competitive position in the marketplace and expects to continue to invest
heavily in R&D to remain competitive.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense
(SG&A)
Expenditures for
SG&A increased $45 million and $89 million, respectively, for the three and
six month periods ended March 27, 2004, or 15%, compared to the same periods in
2003.  These increases are due primarily
to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on
marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with
restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses
resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases.
 
Restructuring Costs
During the second
quarter of 2004, the Companys management approved restructuring actions that
resulted in the recognition of a total restructuring charge of $9.6
million.  These actions were related to
the closing of the
Companys Sacramento manufacturing operations within the Americas operating
segment and headcount reductions
 
31







 
related primarily to various sales and marketing activities in the
Companys Americas and Europe operating segments.  These restructuring actions will ultimately result in the
termination of 348 positions, 69 of which had been terminated prior to the end
of the second quarter of 2004.
 
The approved plan to cease manufacturing operations in Sacramento
resulted in severance for 200 employees at a cost of $1.9 million, which is
expected to be paid during the third quarter of 2004. The Company recognized a
charge related primarily to restructuring actions associated with sales and
marketing activities in the United States and Europe for employee severance
costs of $7.7 million, the majority of which will be paid before the end of fiscal
year 2004, for the termination of 148 positions. Once fully implemented,
the Company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced
ongoing quarterly operating expenses of approximately $6 million.
 
In the third
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company expects to incur additional restructuring
charges of approximately $10 million primarily related to finalizing the
closing of its Sacramento manufacturing operations.
 
During the second
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8
million. The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the
most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and
focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing
functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further
reductions associated with PowerSchool related activities in the Americas
operating segment.
 
During the first
quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a net restructuring charge of $23 million
related primarily to the termination of manufacturing operations at the
Company-owned facility in Singapore, reductions in headcount resulting from the
shift in PowerSchool product strategy, and termination of various sales and
marketing activities in the United States and Europe.

Gain on Sales of Non-current
Investments
During the first quarter of
2004, the Company sold its remaining non-current investments in public
companies consisting of 986,164 shares of Akamai Technologies for net proceeds
of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of $4 million. As of March
27, 2004, the Company does not have any non-current public company investments
reflected in its condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the first quarter
of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds
of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Companys
carrying value of the shares sold. No sales of the Companys non-current debt
and equity investments were made in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Interest and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other
income, net decreased $11 million or 48% to $12 million during the second
quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003 and decreased $31 million
or 60% for the first six months of 2004 from the same period in 2003. These
decreases are attributable primarily to declining investment yields on the
Companys cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market interest
and a shortening of the average maturity of the
 
32







 
Companys investment portfolio.
The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.32% in the second quarter of
2004 compared to the 1.72% rate earned during the same period in 2003. The
Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated
maturities. The sale of short-term investments during the first and second
quarters of 2003 were intended to shorten the average maturity of the Companys
investment portfolio based on managements belief that interest rates were at
or near their bottom. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net
gains of $9 million during the second quarter of 2003 and $18 million during
the first six months of fiscal 2003. No gains on early sales of short-term
investments were recognized in either the first or second quarter of 2004.
 
Interest expense consisted
primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregate principal
amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004;
partially offset by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001
that resulted from the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured
notes. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield
to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt
swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes
maturity in February 2004.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
The Companys
effective tax rate for the first three and six month periods ended March 27,
2004 was approximately 28%. The Companys effective rate differs from the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed
foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and due to research and
development credits.
 
On April 10, 2003, the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) completed its audit of the Companys federal income tax
returns for the years 1998 through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments.
Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals
Office.  Substantially all IRS audit
issues for years prior to 1998 have been resolved. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved
in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution
occurs.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2003, the
Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.
104, Revenue
Recognition, which supercedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.  SAB 104
clarifies existing guidance regarding revenue contracts that contain multiple
deliverables to make it consistent with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No.
00-21.  The adoption of SAB 104 did not
have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial
position.
 
In December 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 46R, a
revision to FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.  FIN 46R clarifies some of the
provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements.  FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first
interim period ending after March 15, 2004. 
The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Companys
results of operations or financial position.
 
In March 2004, the FASB issued
EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1 includes new
guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity
investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are
deemed to be temporarily impaired. The accounting guidance of EITF 03-1 is
effective for years beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure
requirements are effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004.
Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03-1,
management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on
its results of operations or financial position.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently measures
compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of
the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has
elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part I,
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q at Note 1 of the Notes to
 
33







 
Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No.
25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation
expense is recognized.
 
On March 31, 2004, the FASB
issued a proposed Statement, Share-Based Payment, that addresses the
accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives
employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or
(b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments.
The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25 and generally would require
instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method.  If adopted in its current form,
the proposed Statement would be effective for the Company beginning in its
fiscal year 2006.
 
At the Companys annual shareholders
meeting on April 24, 2003, shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the
Companys Board of Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the
value of all future employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and
management appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Companys
shareholders. The Company decided not to expense the value of employee stock
options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter,
which will play a significant role in determining the fair value of and
accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors progress at the
FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of employee stock
compensation. The Company is currently reviewing the potential impact from the
guidance of the proposed statement, which may require the Company to recognize
substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a
material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations.

As of March 27, 2004, the Company had $4.594 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $28 million over
the same balances at the end of fiscal 2003. Approximately $2.8 billion of this
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by the Companys
foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation to the U.S. The principal components of this increase were cash
generated by operating activities of $280 million, and proceeds of $108 million
from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash
used to repay the Companys outstanding debt of $300 million and purchases of
property, plant, and equipment of $79 million.
 
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing
operations over the next 12 months.
 
34







 
Debt
The Company had debt
outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5%
unsecured notes that were originally issued in 1994 and were repaid upon their
maturity in February 2004. The notes, which paid interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.
 
Capital Expenditures
The Companys total capital
expenditures were $79 million during the first six months of fiscal 2004, $48
million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the
Companys Retail segment and $31 million of which were for corporate
infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating
facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it
will utilize approximately $190 million for capital expenditures during 2004,
approximately $110 million of which is expected to be utilized for expansion of
the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal
replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information
technology infrastructure.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. 
This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a
total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was
authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock
as of March 27, 2004.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has
not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the
Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to
material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
 
Lease Commitments
As of September 27, 2003, the
Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of
approximately $600 million, $354 million of which related to the lease of
retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing
operating leases range from 1 to 11 years. Total outstanding commitments on
noncancelable operating leases related to the lease of retail space rose to
$376 million as of March 27, 2004.
 
Purchase Commitments with Contract
Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes several
contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products
and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract
manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information
supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3
months. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a
wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the
Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase
commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature
of the Companys outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and
component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the end of
its fiscal 2003.  As of March 27, 2004,
the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component
purchase commitments of approximately $700 million.
 
Indemnifications
The Company generally does not
indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against
legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property
rights. Other licensing agreements entered into by the Company sometimes
include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to
costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company
or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to
make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim
asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of
management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved
infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
and Financial Condition
 
Because of the
following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating
results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors
should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future
periods.
 
General economic conditions and current
economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the
Companys products and the financial health of its suppliers,
distributors, and resellers.
The Companys
operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For
much of the past several years, demand for the Companys products has been
negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some
of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases
due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget
deficits on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future
economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.
Should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or deteriorate,
demand for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the
financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
 
War, terrorism or public health issues could
disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect
the Companys operations and performance.
War, terrorism or public health
issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause
damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and
political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global
economy, the Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers.  Although it is impossible to predict the
occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a
decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it difficult or impossible
to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its
suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply
chain. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and
in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these events.
 
The Company and some of its
manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations in
various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which were
subject to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) travel advisories at times
during fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a
significant amount of both the Companys portable Macintosh systems and iPods
are assembled. Should the severity of the SARS threat increase or other public
health issues arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for
more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers.
 
The market for personal computers and related
peripherals and services is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to
effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be
adversely affected.
The personal computer industry
is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices,
downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products,
short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement
in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological
and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of
consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years,
price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals
has been particularly intense. The Companys competitors who sell Windows-based
personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product
margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to the weakness
in demand that began in the second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing
products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition have
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and
other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
The personal computer industry
has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software
functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging
industry standards.  Further, as the
personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the
Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler
than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the
Companys existing products.  Several competitors
of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target
certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education,
professional and consumer
 
36







 
digital video editing, and
design and publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or
announced plans to introduce digital music products that mimic many of the
unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The
Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater
financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as
broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the
Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal
computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger
competitors in the Companys markets.
 
The Company is currently the
only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share
in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers
utilizing Microsofts Windows operating systems. The Companys future operating
results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to
continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain
perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including
Windows.
 
The Company is currently
focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and
related consumer electronic devices including iPods. The Company faces
increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music
distribution services, free peer-to-peer music services, emerging companies,
and larger companies that may have greater resources, including technical and
marketing resources, and supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete
could negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to provide products and
services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute
and sell digital music outside the U.S.
 
The Company has higher research and
development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of
revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent
upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and
competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the
Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue
than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating
systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and
maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the
Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys
brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling
costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company
is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with
attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely
affected by its operating cost structure.
 
The Company must successfully manage frequent
product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and
effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly volatile
nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic
customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must
continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products
in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for
new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The
success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors,
including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks
associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability
of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory
levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new
products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.
 
During 2001, the Company
introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first
major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major upgrades include Mac OS X
Jaguar in 2002 and most recently Mac OS X Panther in October 2003. Inability of
the Company to provide additional improvements in the performance and
functionality of the Mac OS, inability to advance customer acceptance of the
operating system and its upgrades, inability to obtain the continued commitment
of software developers to transition existing applications to run on the Mac OS
or create new applications to run on the Mac OS, may have an adverse impact on
the Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
37







 
Because orders for
components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be
placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory
risk.
The Company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete
or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues
necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have
been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related
provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the
Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition,
such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.
 
The Company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast
incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient
inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice,
components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in
customer demand patterns.
 
Future operating results are dependent upon
the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of
which are in short supply or available only from limited sources.
Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key
components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and
optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company
from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and
pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often
initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the
Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies,
additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the
suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal
computer industry also compete for various components with other industries
that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer
industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of
these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on
the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys
requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or
constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to
produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and
desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based
microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company
with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features
that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel
Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by
personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts
to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of
its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz
rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh
systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced
PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient
quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of
operations. In addition, currently IBM is the Companys sole supplier of the G5
processor used in current Power Macintosh products and Motorola is the sole
supplier of the G4 processor. The inability in the future of the Company to
obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive
price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Companys
results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company relies on third-party music
content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.
The Company contracts with
third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Companys
iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to
offer to its customers this third-party music.
 
38







 
Many of the Companys licensing
arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature
and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially
reasonable terms, if at all.  Certain
parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their
music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase
the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music
Store. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music
content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or expand its geographic
reach outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of the Companys
iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including
iPods, may be adversely affected.
 
Third-party content providers
and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management
solutions and other security mechanisms. 
If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the
Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address
such new rights and requirements.  There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could
have a materially adverse affect on the Companys operating results and financial
position.
 
The Company is dependent on manufacturing and
logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside
of the United States.
Many of the Companys products
are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition,
the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.
While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they
also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. It
is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or
quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to
respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with
such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement,
the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer
for warranty service in the event of product defects.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could
adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial
condition.
 
Final assembly of products sold
by the Company is currently conducted in the Companys manufacturing facility
in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton,
California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and
the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in
the Companys products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys
portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by
third-party vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing
or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic,
business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events,
the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.
 
The Companys products, from time to time,
experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and
operating profits.
The Company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere
with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and
products the Company purchases from third-parties that may be beyond its
control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and
fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could
result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other
expense to remedy.
 
The Companys retail initiative has required
and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of
resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Through March 2004, the Company
has opened 78 retail stores including its first international store in Tokyo,
Japan. The Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in
equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and
personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease
commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The
Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this
initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the
Companys results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a
relatively high proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of
depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result,
significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a decline
in sales for any reason.
 
39







 
Certain of the Companys stores
have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as
vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness.
Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores
require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements
than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened five such
stores, including its newest San Francisco store opened in the second quarter
of 2004 and has announced its intentions to open high profile stores in London,
England and Osaka, Japan. Because of their location and size, these high
profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger
operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical
stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years
with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25
million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high
profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks and
uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail
segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could
adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results
to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties
unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail
segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a
negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance
of the Companys retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh
platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at
adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel
partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the United
States; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of
Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality
retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
Unit sales of the Companys professionally
oriented desktop systems have declined over the past several years negatively
impacting net sales and gross margin.
Although net sales and unit
sales of Power Macintosh systems increased 28% and 21%, respectively, in the
first six months of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 due primarily to
the introduction of the Power Mac G5, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems
fell 13% during 2003 and 18% in 2002. In addition, Power Macintosh unit sales
have fallen as a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 30% in 2001 to
22% and 24% in 2003 and the first half of 2004, respectively, primarily as a
result of a shift in preference to portable products. The Company believes that
weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary
users of Power Macintosh systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys
current and potential customers, particularly professional and creative
customers who are most likely to utilize the Companys Power Macintosh systems,
believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the
microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares
unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and translates to
slower overall system performance. In addition to the negative impact on net
sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect
on the Companys overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally
have higher individual gross margins than the Companys consumer Macintosh
systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales could adversely
affect the Companys future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of
Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover, it could be
difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. 
 
The Company faces increasing competition in
the U.S. education market.
Sales in the
United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college
and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in
this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted
or announced their intention to target the education market for personal
computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an
effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and
will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The
Companys 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook
portable system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network
connected to a central server.  These
1:1 solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively
and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial
losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has
taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its
share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic
arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys
operating results and financial condition.

The Companys future operating performance is
dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the
Companys products.
The Company distributes its
products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and
cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In
addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain
third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain
education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the
world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third-party products
through its retail stores. Many of the Companys significant resellers operate
on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by recent economic
conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral
or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail
channel partners. The Companys business and financial results could be
adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weaken, if
resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys
products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys
products.  The Company has invested and
will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales,
including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees.  These programs could require a substantial
investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or
incremental revenue to offset this investment.
 
Over the past several years, an
increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by the Company
directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through
its retail stores in the United States. Some of the Companys resellers have
perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their
own business and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the
Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the
Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and
sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of
the Companys products. The Companys business and financial results could be
adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or
all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products.
 
Further information regarding
risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1
of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2003 under the heading
Markets and Distribution.
 
The Companys business is subject to the
risks of international operations.
A large portion of the
Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result,
the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly
affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on
foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are
purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated
operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign
currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact
consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of
product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
Margins on sales of the
Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include
components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Derivative instruments, such as
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and interest rate swap and
option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The use of such hedging activities may not
offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.
 
Further information related to
the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of the 2003
Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2003 under the subheading Foreign
Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of the 2003 Form 10-K for
the year ended September 27, 2003 at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Companys future performance is dependent
upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software
applications cease to be developed or available for the Companys hardware
products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys products.
The Company believes that
decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed
to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party
software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also
believes the availability of third-party application software for the Companys
hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception and analysis
of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such
software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows
market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the
Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be
generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing
such software products. To the extent the Companys financial losses in prior
years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal
computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS licensing
program, have caused software developers to question the Companys prospects in
the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new
application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys products
and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading
software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no assurance
software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the
Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and future
development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may
negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and
upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company
currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by
professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the
decision of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade
Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently
marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video
and digital photo editing and management, digital music management,
desktop-based database management, and high-quality presentations. The Company
also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word
processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and
presentations in a single application.
 
In August 1997, the
Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and
technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August
2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh
computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its
Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although
Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X,
Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products
subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with
Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its
efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete
directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts
interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration
of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests
as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft
Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an
adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. In June of
2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet
Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsofts decision to discontinue development of
Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced in part by the
Companys introduction during 2003 of its own web browser, Safari. It is
unclear what impact, if any, Microsofts decision to cease further development
of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company. However, if
customers chose not to purchase the Companys products because Internet Explorer
is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites fail to provide
support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the Companys net sales
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Companys business relies on access to
patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the
Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found
to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys products
are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to
various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that
based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could
be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no
assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on
acceptable terms.
 
42







 
Because of technological
changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the
Companys products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing
patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may
be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others.
Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming,
result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and
technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of
evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into
licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be
given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation
will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction
entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its
products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it
to pay royalties to a third-party, the Companys future operating results and
financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain
claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent
infringement and other matters is set forth in Part II, Item 1 of this Form
10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2003 Form 10-K. 
In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability
for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related
to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others
that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail
to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in Part II, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended September
27, 2003 or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in
the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting
period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Company expects its quarterly revenue and
operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.
The Companys profit margins
vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall
profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the
product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that periods net sales.
 
The typical concentration of net sales in the
third month of the Companys fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Companys
business and operating results.
The Company generally sells
more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either
of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry.
This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal
infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the
Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments
late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys
products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key
logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have
significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and
financial condition.
 
The Companys success depends largely on its
ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future success of
the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive
team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys employees are located. The Company has
relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Companys future
ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation
costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully
attract and retain key personnel.
 
The Company is subject to risks associated
with the availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed
rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all
areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in
higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For
some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have
insurance coverage.  For these reasons,
the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has
in the past at relatively greater cost.
 
43







 
Business interruptions could adversely affect
the Companys future operating results.
The Companys major business
operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages,
terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions,
and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and
development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology
systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The
Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses.
The Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or
manmade disaster.
 
Failure of the Companys information technology systems and breaches in
the security of data could adversely affect the Companys future operating
results.
Information technology system failures and
breaches of data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in
the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of
customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting
in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management
has taken steps to address these concerns by its implementation of sophisticated
network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no
assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
 
The Company is exposed to credit risk on its
accounts receivables. This risk is heightened during periods when economic
conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its
products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to
certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial
majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from
certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of
raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company
has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its
trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that such procedures
will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses.
Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or
continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a
material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one
or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The Company is subject to risks associated
with environmental regulations.
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S.  Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations
and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
operation and financial position.
 
Changes in accounting rules could adversely
affect the Companys future operating results.
Financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These
principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including
the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and create appropriate accounting
regulations. A change from current accounting regulations could have a
significant effect on the Companys results of operations and could impact the
manner in which the Company conducts business.
 
Unanticipated changes in the Companys tax
rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future effective
tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes
in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes
in the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its
income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income
taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results
and financial condition.
 
44







 
The Companys stock price may be volatile.
The Companys stock has at
times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market
has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the
market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to
the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of
positive performance in the Companys stock price, as well as general economic
and political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of
corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially
adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the future.
 
The Companys acquisition activity could
disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time
of the transaction.
The Company has acquired and
may continue to acquire companies that have products, services, personnel and
technologies that complement the Companys strategic direction and product
roadmap. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including difficulties in incorporating the acquired companies operations and
technologies; distraction of managements attention away from normal business
operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and
expenses associated with acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in
the Companys due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal
contingencies.  Acquisitions are
inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that the Companys previous or
future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect
business, operating results or financial condition. The Company has generally
paid cash for its acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or
other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition,
current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become
diluted.
 
For a discussion of these and other factors affecting
the Companys future results and financial condition, see Item 7, Managements
Discussion and Analysis - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial
Condition and Item 1, Business in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K.
 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk
profile has not changed significantly from that described in the 2003 Form
10-K.
 
Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk
Management
To ensure the
adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys foreign exchange and interest rate
hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the
non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange
forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and option positions
both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign
currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an
accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons
of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the
exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic
exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results
and financial position.
 
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized
countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to
fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard,
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated
with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys fixed income
investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet
liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of the current credit and
interest rate environment. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing
external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment
portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies
and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements
internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.
 
During 1994, the Company issued
$300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a
public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par,
for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.
 
45







 
The notes paid interest
semiannually and matured in February 2004. The Company used existing cash
in the second quarter of 2004 to settle these notes upon maturity.
 
46







 
The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and related derivative
financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments in highly
liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy
is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly
liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as
short-term investments. As of March 27, 2004, approximately $810 million of the
Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5
years. The remainder all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due
to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the
purpose of duration management of the Companys investment portfolio, the
Company may sell investments prior to their stated maturities. The Company
recognized no net gains or losses during the three and six month periods ended
March 27, 2004 and recognized net gains of $9 million and $18 million during
the three and six month periods ended March 29, 2003.
 
The Company has
historically entered into interest rate derivative transactions, including
interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order
to better match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash
equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on
any outstanding long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company
may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the
cost of the interest rate risk management program.  The Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during the
first six months of either 2004 or 2003 and had no open interest rate asset
swaps at March 27, 2004.
 
In prior years, the Company had
entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest
rate debt swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally required the
Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three or six month U.S.
dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the
underlying notional amounts.  These
swaps effectively converted the Companys fixed-rate 10 year debt to
floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments to
fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company
entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a
gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing
debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and
2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and were amortized to other
income and expense through the maturity of the debt in February 2004.
 
Foreign Currency Risk
Overall, the Company is a net
receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, generally
benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates,
and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the
Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is
also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing
within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive pressures when
there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The Company enters into foreign
currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to
protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly
committed transactions. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures.
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Based on an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act))
were effective as of March 27, 2004 to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
 
There were no
significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
identified in managements evaluation during the second quarter of fiscal 2004
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.
 
48







 
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed below. The Company is
also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. In
the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability
related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or
in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any
of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

patent infringement relating to IEEE 1394 technology, also known as FireWire.
Plaintiff claims that any computer system or other electronic product that uses

unspecified damages and other relief. The Company has answered the complaint,
denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The
Company also asserted counterclaims requesting declaratory judgment for

of the Units.
 
(a)  Release
Date. 
            %
of the Units shall vest on [DATE] and
                  %
of the Units shall vest on [DATE] (the Release Dates) provided that Grantee
has remained continuously employed by Apple, or any parent or subsidiary of
Apple, until each such Release Date.
 
(b)  Termination
Without Cause Prior to Release Date. In the event of termination by Apple
of Grantees employment other than for Cause (as defined below) prior to any
Release Date, all unvested Units shall be fully vested in Grantee as of such
termination date.
 
(c)  Resignation
for Good Reason Following a Change in Control.  In the event there is a Change in Control of Apple (as defined
in Section 16(d) of the 2003 Plan) and if in connection with or following
such Change in Control, the Grantees employment is terminated without Cause
or if the Grantee resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), all unvested
Units shall be fully vested in Grantee as of such termination or resignation
date.
 
(d)  Termination
Due to Death.  In the event of
termination of employment due to Grantees death prior to a Release Date, that
number of Units deemed to have vested on a pro rata daily basis from the Date
of Grant to the date of death shall be immediately vested in Grantee as of the
date of death.  Any Units not so vested shall be immediately forfeited.
 
(e)  Termination
for Other Reasons.  In the event
that Grantees employment with Apple, or any parent or subsidiary of Apple,
terminates prior to a Release Date for any reason other than those specified in
Sections (b), (c) and (d) above, including termination voluntarily by Grantee
or by Apple for Cause, any unvested Units shall be immediately forfeited.
 







 
(f)                                    Certain
Definitions.
 
(i)                                     Cause.
For purposes of this Section 2, Cause shall mean a termination of
Grantees employment which is a result of (i) Grantees felony conviction, (ii)
Grantees willful disclosure of material trade secrets or other material
confidential information related to the business of Apple and its subsidiaries
or (iii) Grantees refusal or failure to perform [his or her] duties with Apple
(other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or
mental illness) or to comply with the reasonable directions received from or
policies established by Apple, the CEO, or the Board of Directors or (iv) any
act or omission that is the result of willful misconduct or gross negligence
and that, in the good faith opinion of Apple, is injurious in any material
respect to the financial condition, business or reputation of Apple.
 
(ii)                                  Good
Reason.  For purposes of this
Section 2, Good Reason shall mean a resignation of Grantees employment
as a result of any of the following:
 
(a)                                  A
substantial diminution in Grantees position or duties, or an adverse change to
Grantees title from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in
Control;
 
(b)                                 A
reduction by Apple in Grantees annual base salary as in effect immediately
prior to the Change in Control or the failure to pay Grantees salary when due;
 
(c)          The relocation of the
office of Apple where Grantee is employed as of the Change in Control to a
location which is more than seventy-five (75) miles away from such location, or
a requirement that Grantee be based more than seventy-five (75) miles away from
the employment location as of the Change in Control;
 
which, in any case, is
not remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from
Grantee to Apple, specifically delineating each such act and setting forth
Grantees intentions to resign if such breach is not duly remedied, provided,
that if the specified breach cannot be remedied within said thirty (30)-day
period and Apple commences reasonable steps within said thirty (30)-day period
to remedy such breach and diligently continues such steps thereafter until a
remedy is effected, such breach shall not constitute Good Reason.
 
3.                                       Restriction
on Transfer.  Grantee shall not
sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any Units or the
consideration to be received upon payout of vested Units prior to the
applicable payout date.
 







 
4.                                       Payout
of Units.
 
(a)                                  Status
as a Creditor.  Unless and until Units
have vested in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 2
above, Grantee shall have no right to a payout with respect to any Units.  Prior to payout of any vested Units, the
vested Units will represent an unsecured obligation of Apple, payable (if at
all) only from the general assets of Apple. 
Grantee is an unsecured creditor of Apple, and payouts are subject to
the claims of Apples creditors.
 
(b)                                 Form
and Timing of Payout.  Vested Units
shall be paid out in the form of shares of Apple common stock (Shares) as
soon as practicable following each Release Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantee may elect to defer payout
by submitting a properly completed Payout Deferral Election Form to Apple at
least twelve (12) months prior to the applicable Release Date and otherwise
complying with the deferral procedures or conditions as Apple may specify from
time to time.
 
5.                                       Tax
Consequences.  Grantee understands
that [he or she] (and not Apple) shall be responsible for [his or her] own tax
liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Grantee understands that [he
or she] will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market
value of the Shares received as of each payout date for such Shares, and
Grantee is obligated to pay applicable income tax withholding on the amount of
ordinary income recognized upon receipt of such Shares.  Grantee shall pay such income tax
withholding amounts to Apple within 24 hours of the payout date for such
Shares. In addition, Grantee understands that Apple will be required to withhold
applicable employment taxes on each Release Date from compensation due Grantee.
To the extent that the compensation due Grantee is insufficient to cover the
applicable employment taxes on each Release Date, Grantee agrees to pay to
Apple within 24 hours of such Release Date, the amount due for employment
taxes.
 
[Note: For grants
permitting net share settlement: Grantee may satisfy such tax withholding
obligations, in whole or in part by: (a) paying cash, or (b) electing to have
Apple withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a fair market value equal to
the minimum amount required to be withheld. 
Unless Grantee notifies Apple otherwise within a reasonable time prior
to the applicable payout date, Grantee will be deemed to have elected to satisfy
the withholding obligations through Apple retaining otherwise deliverable
Shares as provided in clause (b).]
 
6.                                       General
Provisions.
 
(a)                                  This
Agreement and the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan represent the entire
agreement and understanding between the parties as to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written
 







 
or oral.   In the event of a conflict between this
Agreement and the 2003 Plan, the provisions of the 2003 Plan will govern.  The Administrator has the power to interpret
the 2003 Plan and this Agreement.  All
interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator will be binding
upon Grantee, Apple, and all other interested parties.
 
(b)                                 This
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
reference to its conflicts of law principles.
 
(c)                                  No
waiver, alteration or modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding, unless in writing and signed by duly authorized
representatives of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding on, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.
 
(d)                                 This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
 
IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement effective as of
the date set forth above.
