APPLE
COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1  Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
 
Apple Computer, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and markets personal
computers and related software, services, peripherals and networking
solutions.  The Company also designs,
develops and markets a line of portable digital music players along with
related accessories and services including the online distribution of
third-party music and audio books.   The
Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail
stores, its direct sales force and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value
added resellers.  In addition to its own
hardware, software and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of
third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail
stores.  The Company sells to education,
consumer, creative professional, business and government customers.
 
Basis of Presentation and
Preparation
The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Interim information is unaudited; however,
in the opinion of the Companys management, all adjustments of a normal
recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of interim periods presented
have been included.  The results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.  Certain prior year amounts in these condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to
conform to the current periods presentation.
 
These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2004, included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004
(the 2004 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular
years or quarters refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and
the associated quarters of those fiscal years.
 
Common Stock Split
On February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock
split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005.  All share and per share information have been
retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
 
Research and Development
Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be
sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when
a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a
product is available for general release to customers pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. In most
instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established; therefore, costs incurred subsequent to
achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and
generally all software development costs have been expensed.
 
In the fourth quarter of
2004, the Company began incurring substantial development costs associated with
the latest version of Mac OS X (code-named Tiger) subsequent to achievement
of technological feasibility as evidenced by public demonstration in August 2004
and the subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product. Therefore,
during the second quarter and first quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of
2004, the Company capitalized approximately $14.7 million, $14.8 million and
$4.5 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Tiger.  Amortization of this asset to cost of sales
will commence when Tiger begins shipping and will be recognized on a
straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.  The final version of the product was released
in April 2005.
 
During the second
quarter of 2004, the Company incurred substantial development costs associated
with FileMaker Pro 7 subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility as
evidenced by public demonstration and release of a developer beta version, and
prior to the release of the final version of the product in March 2004.
Therefore, during 
 
5







 
the second quarter of
2004, the Company capitalized approximately $2.3 million of costs associated
with the development of FileMaker Pro 7. 
In accordance with SFAS No. 86, amortization of this asset to cost
of sales began in March 2004 when FileMaker Pro 7 was shipped and is being
recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful life.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share-Based
Payment, that addresses the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. 
SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such
transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company is
currently evaluating SFAS 123R to determine which fair-value-based model and
transitional provision it will follow upon adoption. The options for transition
methods as prescribed in SFAS 123R include either the modified prospective or the
modified retrospective methods. The modified prospective method requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted
stock as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first quarter of
adoption, while the modified retrospective method would record compensation
expense for stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period
restated. Under the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be
restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods
presented.  SFAS 123R will be effective
for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although the
Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 123R, management
expects adoption to have a material impact on its results of operations.
 
The Company currently
measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The
Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure as if the fair-value-based method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when
the exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense
is recognized.
 
As required under SFAS No. 123,
the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings
per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase
plan share purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning of
the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and
shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options vesting period
and the shares plan period.

Earnings
Per Share
Basic
earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include
the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted
stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury stock method.  Under the
treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys
common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of
restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive
effect on earnings per share.

shares of common stock for the six months ended March 26, 2005 and March 27,

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of investments
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt
securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which
are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses, net of
taxes, of $5.8 million on its investment portfolio, approximately half of which
related to investments with stated maturities of less than one year, as of March 26,
2005.  As of September 25, 2004, the
Company had net unrealized losses, net of taxes, of $4 million on its
investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities
of less than one year. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments
prior to their stated maturities. No material gains or losses were recognized
on any such sales during the three and six month periods ending March 26,
2005 or March 27, 2004.
 
As of March 26, 2005 and September 25, 2004, $327 million and
$180 million, respectively, of the Companys investment portfolio that was
classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5
years.  The remainder of the Companys
short-term investments had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to
time, the Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. As of the end of the first six
months of 2005, the general nature of the Companys risk management activities
and the general nature and mix of the Companys derivative financial
instruments have not changed materially from the end of fiscal 2004.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts
with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated
with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and

 
8







 
forecasted future cash flows. Generally, the Companys practice is to
hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction
exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange
transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of
hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging
instruments.
 
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for all derivatives at fair value. Derivatives
that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As
of March 26, 2005, the Company had a net deferred gain associated with
cash flow hedges of approximately $3.8 million net of taxes, substantially all
of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005.

Note
5  Shareholders Equity
 
Preferred Stock
The Company
has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is
outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Companys authorized
but unissued shares of preferred stock.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan
for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time.  The Company
has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal
2003. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased
a total of 13.2 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was
authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock
as of March 26, 2005.
 
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses,
gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net
income. The Companys other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as
their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities
categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 6  Employee Benefit Plans
 
2003 Employee Stock Option Plan
The 2003 Employee Stock
Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), formerly the 1998 Executive Officer Plan, is a
shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based grants to all employees
in addition to executive officers and other key employees. Based on the terms
of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally
expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over
a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with either annual or
quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock
options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, and stock purchase rights.
 
1997 Employee Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a
non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are
not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants,
options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on
continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. In October 2003,
the Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares totaling 28,590,702.   No new options can be granted from the 1997
Plan.
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee
directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest
in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of
the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully
vested at grant.
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain of the Companys executive officers, including Mr. Timothy
D. Cook, Mr. Peter Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Dr. Bertrand
Serlet, and Dr. Avadis Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and
dates) of future purchases or sales of the Companys stock including the
exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of restricted stock
units.
 
12







 
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase
Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to a maximum of
$25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized for issuance is
limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period. As of March 26,
2005, approximately 2.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under
the Purchase Plan.
 
Subsequent Event  Employee Stock and Bonus
Plans
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 21, 2005, the
Companys shareholders approved the Performance Bonus Plan, a performance-based
annual cash incentive plan for the Companys executive officers. The
shareholders also approved amendments to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan,
including an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the
plan by 49 million shares. In addition, the shareholders approved an amendment
to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
reserved for issuance thereunder by 2 million shares.

restricted stock units were vested as of March 26, 2005. These restricted
stock units have been deducted from the shares available for grant under the
Companys stock option plans.
 
Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has provided
pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if
the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been used for
its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases.
These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and beginning
of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
The assumptions used for
the three and six month periods ended March 26, 2005 and March 27,
2004, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as follows:

Note
8  Commitments and Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The
Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under
noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently
utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility
leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for
terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to
16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year
renewal options. As of September 25, 2004, the Companys total future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $617 million,
of which $436 million related to leases for retail space.  As of March 26, 2005, total future
minimum lease payments related to leases for retail space increased to $489
million.
 
Accrued
Warranty and Indemnifications
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its
hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically
one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day
basic warranty for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products.
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product
warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject
to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys 
 
14







 
typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future expectations.

The
Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software infringes
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not
been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an
infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and,
in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to
unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of
either March 26, 2005 or September 25, 2004.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September 27,
2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are substantially identical, and
purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who purchased the Companys publicly
traded common stock between July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000.
The complaints allege violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek
unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion
to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13,
2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the Companys motion to
dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave to Plaintiffs to
amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed their amended
complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company
filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard the Companys
motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims with prejudice on
August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs appealed the ruling.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal heard the
matter on February 17, 2005 and affirmed the District Courts ruling in an
unpublished decision dated April 4, 2005. 
Plaintiffs will not seek further review and the matter is concluded.
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims
that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a
potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results
of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company
fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal
matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
 
Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries
may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in
some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return
product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the
Company operates including various European Union member countries, Japan and
certain states within the U.S.  Although
the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future
based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position.

Note
9 - Segment Information and Geographic Data
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company reports
segment information based on the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments.
 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not
include activities related to the Retail segment.  The Americas segment includes both North and
South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the
Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. The Retail
segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and the
U.K.  Other operating segments include
Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the
Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating
segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services,
and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those
described in the Companys 2004 10-K in Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail segment.
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based
on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated based on
operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the
location of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales
to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly
attributable to the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other
income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating
segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various
corporate expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard
costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses
include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, manufacturing
costs and variances not included in standard costs, and other separately
managed general and administrative expenses including certain corporate
expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include
cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing facilities,
miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets, and retail store construction-in-progress that is not subject to
depreciation. Except for the Retail segment, capital expenditures for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Capital
expenditures by the Retail segment were $16 million and $20 million during the
second quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $49 million and $48 million
during the first six months of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of
sales at manufacturing standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and
marketing costs, and certain general and administrative costs. This measure of
operating income, which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable
basis for comparison between the Companys various geographic segments.  Certain manufacturing expenses and related
adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between
standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for
product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.
 
Management assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment
differently than it assesses the operating performance of the Companys
geographic segments. The Retail segment revenue and operating income is
intended to depict a measure comparable to that of the Companys major channel
partners in the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the
Retail segment performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the
Company makes three significant adjustments to the Retail segment for
management reporting purposes that are not included in the results of the
Companys other segments.
 
First, the Retail segments operating income includes cost of sales for
Apple products at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the
U.S. operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives
provided to those channel partners and the Companys cost to support those
partners. For the second quarter of 2005 and 2004, this resulted in the
recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail
segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $102
million and $45 million, respectively. For the first six months of 2005 and
2004, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above
standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate
expenses of approximately $201 million and $97 million, respectively.
 
17







 
Second, the Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts
are transferred to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the
Companys major retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a measure of
revenue and gross margin for those items that is comparable between the Companys
Retail stores and those retail channel partners.  The Retail segment recognizes the full amount
of revenue and cost of sales of the Companys extended warranty, support and
service contracts at the time of sale. Because the Company has not yet earned
the revenue or incurred the costs associated with the sale of these contracts,
an offset to these amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales
and cost of sales. For the second quarter of 2005, this resulted in the
recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $21 million and $15
million, respectively. For the second quarter of 2004, the net sales and cost
of sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts recognized by the
Retail segment were $12 million and $8 million, respectively. For the first six
months of 2005, this resulted in the recognition of additional net sales and
cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other
operating segments, of $41 million and $28 million, respectively. This compares
to similar adjustments to net sales and cost of sales during the first six
months of 2004 of $24 million and $16 million, respectively.
 
Third, the Company has opened seven high profile stores in New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka, Japan, and London,
England as of March 26, 2005.  These
high profile stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and
were designed to further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for
certain corporate sales and marketing activities, including corporate
briefings.  As such, the Company
allocates certain operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The
allocation of these operating costs is based on the amount incurred for a high
profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail
location. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the
operations of these stores were $7.1 million and $4.0 million in the second
quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $14.0 million and $6.2 million for
the first six months of 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note 10  Related Party Transactions and
Certain Other Transactions
 
In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement
with its CEO, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred
by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used for Apple
business.  The Reimbursement Agreement
became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business
purposes since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized
a total of $62,000 and $40,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement during the second quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
$481,000 and $322,000 in expenses for the first six months of 2005 and 2004.
All expenses recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been
included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations.

Executive Overview
The Company designs,
manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, services,
peripherals and networking solutions. 
The Company also designs, develops and markets a line of portable
digital music players along with related accessories and services including the
online distribution of third-party music and audio books. The Companys
products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook
computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID
storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software
applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the online iTunes Music Store, a
portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod
product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The
Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail
stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and
value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party
Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing
supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital video and still cameras,
personal digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies
through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business and government customers.  A further description of the Companys
products may be found below and in Part I, Item 1 of the Companys 2004 Form 10-K.
 
The Companys business
strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own
operating system, hardware and many software applications and technologies, to
bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions
with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration and innovative industrial
design.
 
The Company participates in several highly competitive markets,
including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer
electronics with its iPod line of digital music players and distribution of
third-party digital music through its online iTunes Music Store.  While the Company is widely recognized as an
innovator in the personal computer market as well as a leader in the emerging
market for distribution of digital music, these are highly competitive markets
that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition.  In order to remain competitive, the Company
believes that increased investment in research and development (R&D) and marketing
and advertising is necessary in order to maintain and extend its position in
the markets where it competes.  The
Companys R&D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and
enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating
systems, software applications and portable music players; developing new
digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and
investing in new product areas such as rack-mount 
 
20







 
servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies.  The Company also believes that investment in
marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand
awareness.
 
The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution
channels.  The Company believes that
sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by
knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software
and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions
that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the
compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks.  The Company further believes that providing a
high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting
and retaining customers.  To ensure a
high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education
are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities
by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally.  The Company had 103 stores open as of March 26,
2005.
 
The Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Companys
own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels.  The Company has deployed Apple employees in
reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan and
Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online
stores around the world.
 
To improve the accessibility to its iPod product line, the Company has
significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold.
The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores,
member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require
the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that
affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Companys 2004 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies
and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these
estimates and such differences may be material.
 
Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and
estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase
commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles,
warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys
financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments
and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related
disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors.
 
Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (e.g.,
hardware, software, music products, and peripherals), and extended warranty and
support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable
accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended, and Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition.
 
The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is
probable.  Generally, product is
considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and
risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to
individuals, for some sales to education customers, and for certain other
sales, the Company defers revenue recognition until the customer receives the
product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on
these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company
determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or
determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become
due and payable.
 
21







 
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments
related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including
reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based
incentives.  The estimated cost of these
programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has
sold the product and committed to a plan. 
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market
conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer
incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that
could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are
offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management
to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive
based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of
particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record
additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on
the Companys results of operations.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and
directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company
generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when
possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables
with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring
arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct
customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the
third-party financing company and the end customer.  As such, the Company generally does not
assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these
arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners.
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration
of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers.
The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the
amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible.  The Company also records an allowance for all
other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical
experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial
condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such
receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial
condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to
the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on
trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the
Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would
affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.
 
Inventory
Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for
inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for
resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each
period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life
cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component
cost trends. The personal computer and consumer electronic industries are
subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence
and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys
products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological
changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may
be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect
gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded.
 
The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to
component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice,
the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information.
These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods
ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in
demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in
technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may
be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would
negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are
identified.
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Including
Acquired Intangibles
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain
identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be
recoverable. 
 
22







 
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their
carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no
material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment
or identifiable intangibles during the past two fiscal years, except those made
in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Companys
business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including
deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to
such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are
identified.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, the Company performs a review of goodwill
for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is subjective and
requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the
Companys business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair
value of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the
Company determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated
fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less
than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of
all identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner
similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires
independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets
including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once
this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be
determined.
 
Based on the Companys estimates as of March 26, 2005 there was no
impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including
changes in the Companys market capitalization, changes in the Companys
forecasts, and changes in the Companys internal business structure could cause
one or more of the Companys reporting units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the
personal computer and consumer electronics industries and changes in global or
regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its
resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting
businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and
equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill.
 
Warranty Costs
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product
warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical
and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim,
and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys
typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to
assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size
of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts
the amounts as necessary.  If actual
product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the
estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the
Companys results of operations.
 
Income
Taxes
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax
consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.  The Company is
currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004, which, if implemented by the Company, would affect the Companys
tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning
strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will
be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.  In the event that all or part of the net
deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an
adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the
period such determination is made. 
Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that
were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or
a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made.  In addition, the 
 
23







 
calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in
estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax
laws.  Resolution of these uncertainties
in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position.

Net sales during the second quarter of 2005 increased 70% or $1.334
billion from the same quarter in 2004, and were up 72% or $2.818 billion for
the first six months of fiscal 2005 compared to the same period of fiscal
2004.  Several factors contributed to
these increases including:
 
                  Net
sales of iPods increased $750 million, or 284% during the second quarter of
2005 compared to the same period in 2004, and increased $1.705 billion or 328%
in the first half of 2005.  Unit sales of
iPods totaled 5.3 million during the second quarter of 2005, which represents
an increase of 558% from the 807,000 units sold in the second quarter of
2004.  For the first six months of 2005,
iPod unit sales increased 542% to 9.9 million units sold compared to 1.5
million units sold in the prior year. Since introduction of the iPod product
line in fiscal 2002, the Company has sold in excess of 15 million iPods. Strong
iPod demand for the quarter and first six months continued to be experienced in
all of the Companys operating segments. 
These results were driven by several factors, including strong sales of
the new iPod shuffle in January 2005, the release of the new iPod mini in February 2005,
price reductions associated with both iPod photo and iPod mini in the second
quarter of 2005, and expansion of the iPods distribution network during the
first six months of 2005.
 
                  Other
music products consist of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod
related services and accessories.  Net
sales of other music products increased 260% to $216 million in the second
quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.  A similar increase of 267% in net sales of
other music products was experienced for the first half of 2005 compared to the
first half of 2004.  The Company has
experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories resulting
from the increase in overall iPod unit sales for both the second quarter and
first half of 2005. Likewise, the iTunes Music Store has experienced strong
growth in sales in both the second quarter and first half of 2005 as a result
of substantial growth in sales in the U.S. and expansion to Europe and Canada.
 
                  Total
Macintosh net sales increased by 29% and 28% during the second quarter and
first six months of 2005 compared with the same periods in 2004.  Unit sales during the second quarter and
first half of 2005 also reflected increases of 43% and 34%, respectively, compared
to the same period in the prior year.  
These increases in net sales and unit sales relate primarily to strong
demand for the Companys consumer-oriented iMac and iBook products, offset by a
slight decline in Power Macintosh net sales. 
Net sales of consumer-oriented products increased 60% and 77% for the
three and six months ended March 26, 2005, respectively, compared to the
same periods in 2004.  Unit sales showed
increases of approximately 71% for both the second quarter and first half of
2005 compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases are largely
attributable to the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005, the iMac
G5 at the end of fiscal 2004 and the upgrade of the iBook in October 2004.  In addition, PowerBook net sales increased
23% in the second quarter of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004,
primarily as a result of a refresh and a simultaneous price drop to the
PowerBook product line in the second quarter of 2005.  The Company also believes that a shift in
customer preference from desktop systems to portable systems continues. Net
sales per Macintosh unit sold during the second quarter of 2005 decreased 10%
to $1,396 compared to the same quarter in 2004, and decreased 5% to $1,465
during the first six months of 2005 from $1,539 in 2004.  These decreases were the result of changes in
overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer products,
specifically the impact of the new Mac mini product, partially offset by an
increase in direct sales.
 
                  The
Retail segments net sales grew 115% to $571 million during the second quarter
of 2005 and grew by 110% to $1.132 billion in the first half of 2005 compared
to the same periods in the prior year. 
These increases are largely attributable to the increase in total stores
from 78 at the end of the second quarter of 2004 to 103 as of March 26,
2005, as well as a 60% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store.
While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened
stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the
Companys preexisting sales channels in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K., the
Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales
is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below
related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
                  Net
sales of peripherals and other hardware rose $42 million or 18% during the
second quarter of 2005 compared to the same quarter in 2004, and increased $104
million or 23% in the first half of 2005 as a 
 
28







 
result of increased net sales of displays and
other computer accessories. Net sales of other computer accessories include
AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third-party
hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other
hardware was experienced by all of the Companys operating segments.
 
                  The Companys
U.S. education channel experienced an increase in net sales and unit sales of
25% and 21%, respectively for the second quarter of 2005 compared to the same
period in the prior year.  For the first
six months of 2005, net sales and unit sales increased 22% and 16%,
respectively, compared to the first half of 2004. These increases were driven
predominantly by strength in the higher education market. While revenue from
the K-12 market was slightly higher in the second quarter and first half of
2005 than the same periods of 2004, the Company believes this market continues
to be subject to budget constraints.
 
                  Net
sales of software rose $7 million or 6% during the second quarter of 2005
compared to the same quarter in 2004, while decreasing $25 million or 9% for
the first six months of 2005 compared to the same period in the prior year. The
slight increase in software for the quarter reflects higher sales of
application software in 2005 compared to 2004. 
The year-over-year decrease in software for the first half of 2005 is
attributable primarily to a decrease in sales of the Companys Mac OS X Panther
operating system, which was originally released in the first quarter of 2004,
as customers awaited the release of the Companys newest operating system, Mac
OS X Tiger, which became available at the end of April 2005.
 
                  Service
and other sales rose over 75% during the second quarter and rose 63% for the
first six months of 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004.  These increases are the result of significant
year-over-year increases in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan
(APP) extended maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net
sales associated with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales
associated with APP are primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and
higher attach rates on APP over the last several years.
 
Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net
sales during the second quarter and first half of 2005 were negatively impacted
by the following factors:
 
                  Net
sales and unit sales of the Companys Power Macintosh declined in the second
quarter of 2005 and for the first half of 2005, compared to the same periods in
the prior year.   The Companys Power
Macintosh net sales decreased 8% and 6% for the second quarter and first half
of 2005, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2004.  Unit sales also decreased 19% for both the
three and six month periods ending March 26, 2005, compared to the same
periods in 2004. These declines in Power Macintosh are partially attributable
to strong sales in the first and second quarters of 2004, following the
products introduction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2003.  In addition, the Company believes that the
Power Macintosh decline in 2005 may have resulted from a shift in customer
preference away from the single processor Power Mac G5 towards the iMac G5 and
the continued shift to portable systems.
 
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not
include activities related to the Retail segment within those geographies. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan.  The Retail
segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and
the U.K. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware
and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the
Companys operating segments may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q
in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment
Information and Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment grew 64% or $562 million in the
second quarter of 2005 compared with the same quarter in 2004.  For the first six months of 2005, net sales
grew $1.275 billion, a 71% increase, compared to the same period of 2004. The
increase in net sales for the second quarter and first half of 2005 was
primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod
sales, sales of other music products, and strong sales of the Companys
consumeroriented iMac and iBook products, partially offset by lower Power
Macintosh sales.  For the 
 
29







 
three and six month periods ended March 26, 2005, Macintosh unit
sales in the Americas segment increased by 32% and 29%, respectively.
 
As noted above, the
Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 25% and
22% for the second quarter and first six months of 2005, respectively, compared
to the same periods in the prior year. This increase in U.S. education net
sales relates primarily to strength in higher education net sales that drove
year-over-year growth of 45% and 35% for the three and six months periods ended
March 26, 2005, respectively. 
Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong demand
for the refreshed PowerBook product introduced in the second quarter of 2005
and continued demand for the iMac G5 introduced in the fourth quarter of
2004.  The Companys K-12 net sales
increased by 5% and 10% for the second quarter and first half of 2005,
respectively, compared with the same periods in the prior year.  The Company believes the K-12 market
continues to be subject to budgetary constraints, which have limited year-over-year
growth in net sales.
 
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased $256 million or 57% during the second
quarter of 2005 as compared to the same quarter in 2004, and increased $584
million or 60% for the first six months of 2005 compared to the same period in
2004. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe were up 48% and 40% in the second
quarter and first half of 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004,
respectively.  Consistent with the
Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales of iPod, other music
products and consumer-oriented iMac and iBook products.  In addition, the Europe segment experienced
strong sales of peripherals and other hardware, including sales of
Apple-branded and third-party displays and other hardware accessories.
 
Japan
Japans net sales
increased 64% to $284 million during the second quarter of 2005 compared to the
same quarter in 2004, and increased $139 million or 42% for the first six
months of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.  The net sales increase in Japan was the
result of strong net sales of iPod, other music products, iMac products, and
peripherals and other hardware.  These
increases were partially offset by lower iBook sales. Unit sales in Japan
increased 34% and 8% for the second quarter and first half of 2005,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. When net sales
from the Japan retail stores are added in the results for the Japan segment the
combined revenue in Japan resulted in a increase of 72% and 50% for the second
quarter of 2005 and first half of 2005, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2004.
 
Retail
The Company opened two new retail stores during the second quarter of
2005, including its fourth international store, which is located in Nagoya,
Japan.  At the end of the second quarter
of 2005, the Company had 103 retail stores open compared to 78 open stores at
the end of the second quarter of 2004. 
The Retail segments second quarter 2005 net sales grew by $305 million
or 115% from the same quarter in 2004. 
Net sales for the first six months of 2005 grew to $1.132 billion from
$539 million during the same period of 2004, a 110% increase.  The Retail segment experienced strong net
sales for the second quarter and first half of 2005 across all product lines,
except for the Power Macintosh, net sales of which were relatively flat. With
an average of 102 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per
store increased 60% to $5.6 million, up from $3.5 million in the year-ago
quarter.
 
As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail
segment reported profit of $42 million and $87 million during the second
quarter and first six months of 2005 as compared to profit of $5 million and
$14 million during the second quarter and first six months of 2004. This
improvement in profitability is primarily attributable to the segments
year-over-year growth in average quarterly revenue per store, the impact of
opening 25 new stores, and the segments overall increase in net sales for the
second quarter and first six months of 2005, which resulted in higher leverage
on occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs.
 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating
lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital
expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled
$394 million through the end of fiscal 2004, and totaled $49 million during the
first six months of 2005. As of March 26, 2005, the Retail segment had
approximately 2,831 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments
associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $489
million.

Gross margin of 29.8%
and 29.2% for the three and six months ended March 26, 2005, respectively,
increased from 27.8% and 27.2% for the same periods in 2004. The year-over-year
increases in quarterly and year-to-date gross margins were primarily due to
more favorable pricing on certain commodity components, a greater mix of direct
sales, and higher overall revenue that provided for more effective leverage on
fixed production costs.  In addition,
gross margins during the second quarter and first half of 2004 were negatively
impacted due to pricing actions on certain Power Mac G5 models that were
transitioned during 2004 and purchase order cancellation costs associated with
those product transitions.
 
The Company expects gross margin to be approximately 130 basis points
lower in the third quarter of 2005 than in the second quarter of 2005 primarily
due to the following factors: an expected third quarter increase in K-12
education sales which typically consist of products with lower average selling
prices and corresponding lower margins, such as iBooks and iMacs; the full
quarter impact of the lower margin iPod shuffle and Mac mini products, which
were introduced in January 2005; and the full quarter impact of price
reductions taken in the second quarter of 2005 on certain products, including
iPod photo, iPod mini, displays and PowerBooks. Partially offsetting these
factors is an expected favorable impact on gross margins from Mac OS X software
sales, related to Mac OS X Tiger, which began shipping in April 2005.
 
The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin,
increased K-12 education sales, and Mac OS X sales are forward-looking. Gross
margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors,
including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled Factors
That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. There can be no
assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin
levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products
will be maintained.

Research and Development (R&D)
R&D remained
relatively flat decreasing 3% or $4 million to $119 million in the second
quarter of 2005 compared to $123 million in the same period in 2004, while
R&D during the first half of 2005 remained unchanged from the levels
experienced in the first half of 2004. 
The slight year-over-year decrease in quarterly R&D relates
primarily to capitalization of $14.7 million in software development costs associated
with Mac OS X Tiger in the second quarter of 2005, offset by an increase in
R&D headcount to support expanded R&D activities. The Company also
capitalized software development costs in the second quarter of 2004 totaling
$2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7. In the first half
of 2005, the Company capitalized approximately $30 million of software
development costs associated with Mac OS X Tiger, which was offset by an
increase in R&D headcount to support expanded R&D activities. R&D
as a percentage of net sales decreased to approximately 4% for the three and
six months ended March 26, 2005 as compared to approximately 6% in the
same periods of the prior year due to the significant increase in total net
sales for the Company of 70% and 72% for the three and six month periods,
 
31







 
respectively.  The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive
position in the marketplace and expects to continue to invest heavily in
R&D to remain competitive.
 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense
(SG&A)
Expenditures for
SG&A increased $102 million and $229 million, respectively, for the three
and six month periods ended March 26, 2005, or approximately 30% and 33%,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2004.  These increases are due primarily to higher
direct and channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant
year-over-year increase in total net sales for the second quarter and first
half of 2005, the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both
domestic and international markets, and a current year increase in
discretionary spending on marketing and advertising. SG&A as a percentage
of net sales decreased to approximately 14% for the three and six months ended March 26,
2005 as compared to approximately 18% in the same periods of the prior year due
to the leverage realized on fixed costs as a result of the significant
year-over-year increase in total net sales for the Company of 70% and 72% for
the three and six month periods, respectively.

Gain on Non-current Investments
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold its remaining
non-current investments in public companies consisting of 986,164 shares of
Akamai Technologies for net proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain
before taxes of $4 million.  As of March 26,
2005, the Company does not have any material non-current public company investments
reflected in its condensed consolidated balance sheet.
 
Interest and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other income, net increased $21 million or 175% to
$33 million during the second quarter of 2005 compared to the same quarter
in 2004 and increased $38 million or 181% for the first six months of 2005 from
the same period in 2004. These increases are attributable primarily to higher
cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields
resulting from higher market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate
earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
increased to 2.37% in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the 1.32% rate
earned during the same period in 2004. 
The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their
stated maturities. No gains or losses on early sales of short-term investments
were recognized in either the second quarter or first half of 2005 or 2004.
 
Interest expense in the prior year consisted primarily of interest on
the Companys $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes,
which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004, partially offset
by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from
the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes.
 
Provision for Income Taxes
The Companys effective
tax rate for the three and six months ended March 26, 2005 was
approximately 33% and 32% respectively compared with approximately 28% for the
same periods of 2004.  The Companys
effective rate for both periods differs from the statutory federal income tax
rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which
no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely
reinvested outside the U.S.  The higher
tax rate in the first six months of 2005 versus 2004 is due primarily to an
overall increase in earnings as well as a greater mix of earnings in the U.S.
 
32







 
The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal
income tax returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain
adjustments.  Certain of these
adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office.  Substantially
all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved.  In addition, the
Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax
authorities.  Management believes that adequate provision has been made
for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.  However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be
predicted with certainty.  Should any
issues addressed in the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not
consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to
adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.
 
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was
signed into law.  The AJCA includes a
provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated,
as defined in the AJCA.  The Company may
elect to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either
fiscal year 2005 or 2006.  The Company is
currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision.  Important factors in the Companys evaluation
include additional clarification of key elements of the provision to be issued
by the U.S. Treasury Department and pending technical corrections by
Congress.  Assuming there is sufficient
additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department and Congress, the Company
expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision
in the fourth quarter of 2005.  A maximum
of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate
provided by AJCA.  However, given the
uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the
preliminary stage of the Companys evaluation, it is not possible at this time
to determine the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income
tax effects of such repatriation.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1
includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt
and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments
that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective
date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition
and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to investments in securities that
are impaired. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of
EITF 03-1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position.
 
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which amends the guidance in Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing,
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously
stated that under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as
to require treatment as current period charges.  SFAS 151 requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of
fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005.  Although the
Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management does
not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys
results of operations or financial position.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  FSP
109-2 provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting
period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on their plans for
repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company is currently
evaluating the repatriation provisions of AJCA, which if implemented by the
Company would affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and
liabilities. However, given the preliminary stage of the Companys evaluation,
it is not possible at this time to determine the amount that may be repatriated
or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which amends Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.  The guidance in
APB Opinion 29 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The
guidance in APB Opinion 29, however, included certain exceptions to that
principle. SFAS 153 amends APB Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and
 
33







 
replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Although the Company will continue to
evaluate the application of SFAS 153, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or
financial position.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
(SFAS 123R), Share-Based Payment, that
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an
enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of
the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such
equity instruments.  SFAS 123R eliminates
the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the
intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead
that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The
Company is currently evaluating SFAS 123R to determine which fair-value-based
model and transitional provision it will follow upon adoption. The options for
transition methods as prescribed in SFAS 123R include either the modified
prospective or the modified retrospective methods. The modified prospective
method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock
options and restricted stock as the requisite service is rendered beginning
with the first quarter of adoption, while the modified retrospective method
would record compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock
beginning with the first period restated. Under the modified retrospective
method, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of
adoption or for all periods presented. 
In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS 123R to
years beginning after June 15, 2005. Therefore, SFAS 123R will be
effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 123R,
management expects adoption to have a material impact on the Companys results
of operations.
 
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to
clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation
to clean up and retire fixed assets, such as a plant or factory, when an asset
retirement depends on a future event. The Company plans to adopt FIN 47 in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006, and does not expect the application of FIN 47 to
have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.

As of March 26, 2005, the Company had $7.057 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $1.593 billion over the
same balances at the end of fiscal 2004. The principal components of this
increase were cash generated by operating activities of $1.311 billion and
proceeds of $406 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans,
partially offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $101
million. The Companys short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in
high credit quality, liquid investments. Approximately $3.9 billion of this
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by the Companys
foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation to the U.S. The Company is
 
34







 
currently assessing the impact of the one-time favorable foreign
dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the AJCA, and may decide to
repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding
commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing
operations over the next 12 months.
 
Capital Expenditures
The Companys total capital expenditures were $101 million during the
first six months of fiscal 2005, $49 million of which were for retail store
facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $52
million of which were for corporate infrastructure, including information
systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The
Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $280 million for
capital expenditures during 2005, approximately $140 million of which is
expected to be utilized for expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the
remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and
enhancements to general corporate infrastructure.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up
to $500 million of its common stock. 
This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any
specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a
total of 13.2 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was
authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock
as of March 26, 2005.
 
Common Stock Split
On February 28,
2005 the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record
as of February 18, 2005.  All share
and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock
split.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations
The Company has not
entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company
has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative
instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to
material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
 
Lease Commitments
As of September 25, 2004, the Company had total outstanding
commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $617 million,
$436 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related
facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing operating leases range
from 2 to 16 years. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating
leases related to the lease of retail space rose to $489 million as of March 26,
2005.
 
Purchase Commitments with Contract
Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture
sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and
test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and
build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which
typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company also obtains
individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders
based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically
cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Companys outstanding
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has
not changed significantly since the end of its fiscal 2004.  As of March 26, 2005, the Company had
outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of approximately $1.13 billion.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with
commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original
condition upon lease termination. As of September 25, 2004, the Company
estimated that gross
 
35







 
expected future cash flows of approximately $12 million would be
required to fulfill these obligations. 
No significant changes to this estimate have been made during the first
six months of 2005.
 
36







 
Other Obligations
As of September 25, 2004, the Companys other obligations of
approximately $24 million are primarily related to telecommunications services.
No significant changes to this estimate have been made in the first six months
of 2005.
 
Indemnifications
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating
system and application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered
into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which
the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability
related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would
have a material adverse affect on its financial condition, liquidity or results
of operations.
 
Factors That May Affect
Future Results and Financial Condition
Because
of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys
operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should
not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.
 
General economic conditions and current
economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the
Companys products and the financial
health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
The Companys operating
performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S.
and abroad. Over the past several years, demand for the Companys products has
been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally,
some of the Companys education customers appeared to be delaying technology
purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and
state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic
trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about
future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the
Companys products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional
economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could be
adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers,
distributors, and resellers.
 
War, terrorism, public health issues or other
business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products,
which could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance.
War, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions
whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could continue to cause damage
or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political
uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the
Company, and the Companys suppliers or customers. The Companys major business
operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters,
fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes,
medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the
Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters,
information technology systems, and other critical business operations,
including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located
near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake
insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Companys operating results and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a
major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.
 
Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of
any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the
Companys products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to its
customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays
and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain. In addition, should major
public health issues, including epidemics, arise the Company could be
negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services,
governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions,
delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations
of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Companys
operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be
adversely affected by these events.

The market for personal computers and related
peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related
services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively
compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely
affected.
The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross
margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles,
evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance
characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by
competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of
competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for
personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as
competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal
computing products. The Companys results of operations and financial condition
have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these
and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross
margins.
 
The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid
technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and
features based on existing or emerging industry standards.  Further, as the personal computer industry
and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of
Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal
computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing
products.  Several competitors of the
Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of
the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional
and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Companys
competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music
products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic
many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Companys
products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom
have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources,
as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those
of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in
the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially
stronger competitors in the Companys markets.
 
The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS.
The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which
is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating
systems, including Windows and Linux. The Companys future operating results
and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue
to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain
perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms.
 
The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to
digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including
iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting
their own digital music products and distribution services and free
peer-to-peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with different
market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger
companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution and other
resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software
and music content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could
negatively affect the Companys operating results and financial position. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide
products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully
distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S.  The Company may also have to respond to price
competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely
affect the Companys music product gross margins as well as overall Company
gross margins.
 
The Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education
market. Sales in the U.S. to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as
for college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company.
Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have
either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for
personal computers, which could negatively affect the Companys market share.
In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has
been and will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in
education. The Companys 1:1 learning solutions are a complete solution
consisting of an iBook portable system for every student and teacher along with
a wireless network connected to a central server.  These 1:1 learning solutions and other
strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in
significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for
larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to
strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education
market or execute
 
38







 
profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have
an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
The Company must successfully manage frequent
product introductions and transitions in order to remain competitive and
effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal
computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by
dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company
must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing
products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer
demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Companys existing
products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of
factors, including market acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks
associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the
availability of application software for new products; the effective management
of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the availability
of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk
that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of
introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate
effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.
 
The Companys products, from time to time,
experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and
operating profits.
The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that
can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system
software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain bugs
that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may
also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all
defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in
lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to
remedy.
 
Because orders for components, and in some
cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer
orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.
The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and
products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of
orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes
its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and
unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer
electronics industries, no assurance can be given that the Company will not
incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have
had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and
results of operations.
 
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will
forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or
insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry
practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in
customer demand patterns.
 
Future operating results are dependent upon
the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including
microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from
limited sources.
Although most components essential to the Companys business are
generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including
microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or
limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, and
TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from
multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and
pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often
initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the
Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies,
additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the
suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal
computer industry also compete for various components with other industries
that have experienced
 
39







 
increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components
that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including
certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components
may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of
components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If
the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or
existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is
also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor,
Inc. (Freescale), the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor
for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient
supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare
favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by Intel Corporation
and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal
computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to
educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its
current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating
or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems
compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced
PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse
effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently
the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the
Companys current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac G5 products. Freescale is the
sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Companys eMac, Mac
mini, and portable products. IBM has recently experienced manufacturing
problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying
the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments
during the second half of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
Manufacturing problems of either of these suppliers in the future, or failure
by them to deliver microprocessors to the Company in sufficient quantities with
competitive price/performance features could adversely affect the Companys
results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company is dependent on manufacturing and
logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside
of the U.S.
Most of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by
third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its
transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may
lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct control
over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished
control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or
services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing
market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may
contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain
at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in
the event of product defects.  Any
unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to
arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect
the Companys future operating results and financial condition.
 
Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently conducted
in the Companys manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external
vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the
Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently,
manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final
assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including
PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan
and China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these
locations is disrupted by events such as regional economic, business,
environmental, medical, political, information technology system failures, or
military actions, the Companys results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys future operating performance is
dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Companys
products.
The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers,
national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute
products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many
of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major
markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain
resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores.
Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on narrow product margins
and have been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. Considerable
trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The
Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the
financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer
 
40







 
 
channels were to cease
distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for
the Companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing
of the Companys products.  The Company
has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance
reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company
employees.  These programs could require
a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of
return or incremental revenue to offset this investment.
 
Over the past several years, an
increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by the Company
directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through
its retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. Some of the Companys
resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales as
conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and
resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could
discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the
distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease
distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial
results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to
end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of
the Companys products.
 
Further information regarding
risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1
of the 2004 Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004 under the heading
Markets and Distribution.
 
The Company
relies on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company
on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts with
third parties to offer their music content to customers through the Companys
iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to
offer to its customers this third-party music. The Companys licensing
arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature
and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially
reasonable terms, if at all.  Certain
parties in the music industry have announced their intent to consolidate their
music distribution operations, which could limit the availability and increase
the fees required to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music
Store. Further, some third-party content providers currently, or may in the
future, offer music products and services that compete with the Companys music
products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or
impossible for the Company to license their music content in the future. If the
Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at
reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its
geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the
Companys iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals,
including iPods, may be adversely affected.
 
Third-party content providers
and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management
solutions and other security mechanisms. 
If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the
Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address
such new rights and requirements.  There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license such
solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could
have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results and
financial position.
 
The
Companys future performance is dependent upon support from third-party
software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed
or available for the Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not
to buy the Companys products.
The Company believes that
decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed
to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party
software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also
believes the availability of third-party application software for the Companys
hardware products depends in part on third-party developers perception and
analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading
such software for the Companys products versus software for the larger Windows
market or growing Linux market. This analysis is based on factors such as the
perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential
revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X,
and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the minority
market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has caused
software developers to question the Companys prospects in the personal computer
market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software
or upgrade existing software for the Companys products and more inclined to
devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger
Windows market or growing Linux market. Moreover, there can be no assurance
software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the
Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
41







 
In addition, past and future
development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may
negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and
upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys products. The Company
currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by
professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the
decisions of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade
Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently
marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video
and digital photo editing and management, digital music management,
desktop-based database management, word processing, and high-quality
presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application
that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation,
spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.
 
In August 1997, the
Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and
technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August
2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh
computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its
Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although
Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X,
Microsoft has not been obligated to produce future versions of its products
subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with
Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its
efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete
directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts
interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration
of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests
as the vendor of the Windows operating system and competing digital media
applications, including music distribution service and technology. In June of
2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet
Explorer for the Mac OS, subsequent to the Companys introduction during 2003
of its own web browser, Safari.  Further
discontinuance of products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft
Office and other Microsoft products could have an adverse effect on the
Companys net sales and results of operations.
 
The
Companys business relies on access to patents and intellectual property
obtained from third parties, and the Companys future results could be
adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the
intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys products
are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to
various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that
based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could
be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no
assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on
acceptable terms.
 
Because of technological
changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive
patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible
certain components of the Companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement
against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the
Companys future operating results and financial condition could be adversely
affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the
Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth
in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2004 Form
10-K.  In the opinion of management, the
Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any
current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or
other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or
financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the
matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights
of others described in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of
the 2004 Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the

Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

The
Companys retail initiative has required and will continue to require a
substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties.
Through April 2005, the Company
has opened 105 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has required
substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information
systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial
operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to
16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur
substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close
individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of
operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion
of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store
construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would
result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason.
 
Certain of the Companys stores
have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as
vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand
awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these
stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold
improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has
opened seven such stores through March 2005. Because of their location and
size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into
substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for
its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging
from 10 to 16 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms
ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of
these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact
on the Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks and
uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail
segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could
adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results
to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties
unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail
segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a
negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs
associated with store construction and operation; failure to attract new users
to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software
products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing
retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations
outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value
of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality
retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
Investment
in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Companys ongoing
business and may present risks not originally contemplated.
The Company may decide to
invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the
Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of managements
attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation
to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and
unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process.
Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that
such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially
adversely affect the Companys business, operating results or financial
condition.
 
Declines in
the sales of the Companys professional products or increases in sales of
consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages.
Unit sales of the Companys
professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems,
generally have higher gross margins than the Companys consumer products,
including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A
shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower
margin consumer products could adversely affect the Companys future gross
margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys traditional professional
customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and
iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy
the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5
processor used in the Companys Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat
panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks
instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally,
significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher
margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin
percentages.
 
44







 
The Company believes that weak
economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant
users of its professional systems. Also, it is likely that many of the
Companys current and potential professional, creative, and small business
customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that
the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the
Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those
utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall
system performance.  These factors may
result in an adverse impact to sales of the Companys professional products as
well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages.
 
The Company
expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety
of reasons.
The Companys profit margins
vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys direct
sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher
associated profitability than its indirect sales.  Additionally, the Companys direct channels
have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products,
which generally have higher gross margins, than through its indirect
channels.  As a result, the Companys
gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability
may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or
channel mix. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the
third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months,
a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can
produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third
month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict
its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems
failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components
suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on
the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company
has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative
costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth
is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of
innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a
result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a
percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on
other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively
on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the
expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing
the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs
higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors.
If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new
products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be
materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.
 
The Company
is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable. This risk is heightened
during periods when economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its
products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to
certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial
majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who
manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While
the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit
risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that
such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses.
Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or
continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a
material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one
or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The
Companys success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key
personnel.
Much of the future success of
the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled
personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive
team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced
personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and
competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys key employees are located. The Company has
relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the Companys future
ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation
costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully
attract and retain key personnel.
 
45







 
The Company
is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed
rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all
areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may
continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower
coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some
risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance
coverage.  Because the Company retains
some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely,
unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a
material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial
position.
 
Failure of
information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which
the Company relies could adversely affect the Companys future operating
results.
Information
technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the
Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially
causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or
shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer
or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns
for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal
control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or
data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
 
The
Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations.
A large portion of the
Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result,
the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly
affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on
foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are
purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated
operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies,
particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer
demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys
foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and
other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product
components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
Margins on sales of the
Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include
components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Derivative instruments, such as
foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company
to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  The use of such hedging activities may not
offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable
movements in foreign exchange rates.
 
Further information related to
the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of the 2004
Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004 under the subheading Foreign
Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of the 2004 Form 10-K for
the year ended September 25, 2004 at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
The Company
is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.
Production and marketing of
products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. In
the future, these laws could have a material adverse affect on the Companys
results of operations.
 
Changes in
accounting rules could affect the Companys future operating results.
Financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange
 
46







 
Commission (SEC), who interpret
and create appropriate accounting standards. A change from current accounting
standards could have a significant effect on the Companys results of
operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the
accounting for share-based payments, SFAS 123R. 
In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS 123R to years
beginning after June 15, 2005.  
Therefore, SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its
first fiscal quarter of 2006.  Although
the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 123R, management
expects adoption to have a material adverse affect on the Companys results of
operations.
 
Changes in
the Companys tax rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future effective
tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the
valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes
in tax laws or their interpretation.  In
addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income
tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The
Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from
these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.
There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations
will not have an adverse affect on the Companys net income and financial
condition.
 
The
Companys stock price may be volatile.
The Companys stock has at times
experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its
actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by
the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology
companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of
these companies. These factors, including lack of positive general economic and
political conditions and investors concerns regarding the credibility of
corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may
materially adversely affect the market price of the Companys stock in the
future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock price may result in
greater dilution of earnings per share.
 
For a discussion of
these and other factors affecting the Companys future results and financial
condition, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis - Factors That May
Affect Future Results and Financial Condition and Item 1, Business in the
Companys 2004 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk
The Companys market risk
profile has not changed significantly from that described in the 2004 Form
10-K.
 
Interest
Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Company regularly reviews
its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate swap
and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given
the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in
either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the
accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market
instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may
adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position.
 
Interest
Rate Risk
While the Company is exposed to
interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized
countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most sensitive to
fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard,
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated
with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys short-term
investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet
liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of current credit and
interest rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing
external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment
portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies
and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements
internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.
 
The Companys exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys
investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly
liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy
is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly
liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as
short-term investments. As of March 26, 2005, approximately $327 million of the
Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5
years.  The remainder all had underlying
maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior
to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit
deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material
net gains or losses during the three and six month periods ended March 26, 2005
or March 27, 2004 related to such sales.
 
From time to time, the Company
has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial
institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  The Company did not enter into any interest
rate derivatives during the first six months of either fiscal year 2005 or
2004.
 
Foreign
Currency Risk
In general, the Company is a
net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in
U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local
currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been
significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The Company may enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to
protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash
flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign
exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost
of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate
hedging instruments.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Based
on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of March 26, 2005 to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms.
 
There
were no significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting identified in managements evaluation during the second quarter of
fiscal 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
 
PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are discussed
below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and
claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have not
been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have
a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to
prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters
be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating
results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely
affected. The Company settled certain matters during the first six months of
2005, which did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on
the Companys results of operations.

separate plaintiffs filed purported class action cases in various California
courts alleging misrepresentations by the Company relative to iPod battery
life. The complaints include causes of action for violation of California
Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (unfair competition), the
Consumer Legal Remedies Action (CLRA) and claims for false advertising,
fraudulent concealment and breach of warranty. The complaints seek unspecified
damages and other relief. The Company is investigating these claims. The cases
have been consolidated in San Mateo County. On July 26, 2004, Plaintiffs filed
a consolidated complaint.  On August 25,
2004, the Company filed an answer denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  Discovery
is stayed pending settlement discussions among the parties.
 
In
addition, a similar complaint relative to iPod battery life, Mosley v. Apple Computer, Inc. was filed in
Westchester County, New York on June 23, 2004 alleging violations of New
York General Business Law Sections 349 (unfair competition) and 350 (false
advertising). The Company removed the case to Federal Court and Plaintiff filed
a motion for remand, which the Court has not yet decided.  The case is also stayed.
 
Davis v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff
filed this purported class action in San Francisco County Superior Court on
December 5, 2002, alleging that the Company engaged in unfair and
deceptive business practices relating to its AppleCare Extended Service and
Warranty Plan. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for violation of the
California Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500, breach of
the Song-Beverly Warranty Act, intentional misrepresentation and concealment.
Plaintiff requests unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed a
demurrer and motion to strike which were granted, in part, and Plaintiff filed
an amended complaint. The Company filed an answer on April 17, 2003
denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. Plaintiff
subsequently amended its complaint. On October 29, 2003, the Company filed
a motion to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel in his role as counsel to the
purported class and to the general public. The Court granted the motion, but
allowed Plaintiff to retain substitute counsel. Plaintiff did engage new
counsel for the general public, but not for the class. The Company moved to
disqualify Plaintiffs new counsel and to have the Court dismiss the general
public claims for equitable relief. The Court declined to disqualify
Plaintiffs new counsel or to dismiss the equitable claims, but did confirm that
the class action claims are dismissed. The case is stayed pending an appeal.
 
East Texas Technology Partners LP v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff
filed this patent infringement action on January 23, 2004 in the United
States District Court in the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement by
the Company and seven other defendants of U.S. patent 6,574,239 relating to
Virtual Connection of a Remote Unit to a Server. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages and other relief. The Plaintiffs law firm withdrew from
the case because of a conflict of interest and dismissed the complaint without
prejudice. The case was re-filed on February 10, 2004 in the Northern
District of Texas by a new law firm. The Company received service of the new
complaint on May 17, 2004 and filed a response on August 6, 2004,

subsequently referred them to the European Commission.  The European Commission is investigating the
charges under Article 81 and/or 82 of the European Commission Treaty.

drives. The case alleges violations of California Business and Professions Code

Hawaii Structural Iron Workers and Pension Trust
Fund v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Steven P. Jobs; Young v. Apple
Computer, Inc., et al.; Hsu v. Apple Computer Inc., et al.
Beginning
on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are
substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who
purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between July 19,
2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934
Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was
heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the
Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of
action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days.
Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on
March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. The Court heard the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and
dismissed Plaintiffs claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs
appealed the ruling.  The Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeal heard the matter on February 17, 2005 and affirmed the District
Courts ruling in an unpublished decision dated April 4, 2005.  Plaintiffs will not seek further review and
the matter is concluded.

International, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Elite Computers and
Software, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.; The Neighborhood
Computer Store v. Apple Computer, Inc.  MacAccessory Center, Inc. v.
Apple Computer Inc. (all in Santa Clara County Superior Court)
Six
resellers have filed similar lawsuits against the Company for various causes of
action including breach of contract, fraud, negligent and intentional
interference with economic relationship, negligent misrepresentation, trade
libel, unfair competition and false advertising. Plaintiffs request unspecified
damages and other relief. The Company answered the Computer International
complaint on November 12, 2003, denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  Three of
the other plaintiffs filed amended complaints on February 7, 2005 and on March
16, 2005, the Company filed answers denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  The
Company filed an answer in the Macadam case on December 3, 2004 denying all
allegations and asserting numerous defenses.  
All Plaintiffs except Computer International hired new counsel in
December 2004.  All cases except Macadam
are in discovery.  A sixth Plaintiff,
MacAccessory Center filed a complaint on February 23, 2005.  The Company filed a response on April 20,
2005.
 
On
October 1, 2003, one of the reseller Plaintiffs, Macadam, was deauthorized
as an Apple reseller. Macadam filed a motion for a temporary order to reinstate
it as a reseller, which the Court denied. The Court denied Macadams
 
52







 
motion
for a preliminary injunction on December 19, 2003.   On December 6, 2004 Macadam filed for
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the Northern District of California, which placed a
stay on the litigation as to Macadam only. 
The Company filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings on February 16,
2005 to which Macadam has objected.  The
Company took Macadams debtor examination in April 2005.  Macadam filed a motion to employ the same
lawyers working for four of the other reseller plaintiffs as special litigation
counsel to Macadam but subsequently withdrew the motion following the Companys
opposition.  The Company filed a motion
to convert the bankruptcy to Chapter 7 (liquidation) on April 29, 2005.

Direct, Inc. v Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff Tiger Direct, Inc.
filed this trademark infringement action in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida on April 26, 2005 alleging infringement of
the word mark TIGER.  Plaintiff claims to
have a valid registration in the mark TIGER and alleges that the Companys use
of TIGER in reference to the latest version of Mac OS X infringes the mark
allegedly owned by Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
attempted to obtain an ex parte preliminary injunction barring the Companys
use of the TIGER mark on April 27, 2005 but the motion was denied.  Plaintiff served the Company on April 27,
2005 and again moved for a preliminary injunction which was heard on May 3,

(a)   An eligible Employee may become a participant
in the Plan by completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll

the Companys Common Stock determined by dividing the Employees accumulated
payroll deductions (not to exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of his

(i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the
Companys Common Stock on the date of the commencement of said offering period,
or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of
the Companys Common Stock on the date of the expiration of the offering
period, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof,
and subject to the following limitation: The number of shares of the Companys
Common Stock subject to any option granted to an Employee pursuant to this Plan
shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the number of shares of the
Companys Common Stock determined by dividing an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Employees semi-annual Compensation as of the date of the

Companys Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 7(b)
herein.
 
(b)   The option price per share of such shares
shall be the lower of: (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the
Common Stock of the Company at the commencement of the six-month offering
period; or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock

six-month offering period. The fair market value of the Companys Common Stock
on a given date shall be the mean of the reported bid and asked prices for that
date, or if the Common Stock is listed on an exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market, the closing sale price on such exchange or quotation system
for that date.
 
8.     Exercise of Option.
Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10,
his or her option for the purchase of shares will be exercised automatically at
the end of the offering period, and the maximum number of full shares subject
to option will be purchased for him or her at the applicable option price with
the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her account. During his or her
lifetime, a participants option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable

9.     Delivery; Roll-Over of
Fractional Share Interests.
 
As promptly as practicable after
the termination of each offering, the Company shall arrange for the delivery to
each participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the number of
full shares purchased upon exercise of his or her option. No fractional shares
shall be issued. Any cash remaining to the credit of a participants account
under the Plan after a purchase by him or her of shares at the termination of
each offering period which is insufficient to purchase a full share of Common
Stock of the Company subject to option shall remain in such participants
account and shall be applied to the next succeeding offering period unless the
participant has withdrawn as to future offering periods, in which case such
cash shall be returned to said participant. Any cash attributable to shares in
excess of the number of shares subject to option to the participant (as
determined in accordance with Section 7(a) hereof) shall be returned to
the participant.
 
10.   Withdrawal; Termination of
Employment.
 
(a)   A participant may withdraw all but not less
than all the payroll deductions credited to his or her account under the Plan
at any time prior to the end of the offering period by giving written notice to
the Company. All of the participants payroll deductions credited to his or her
account will be paid to him or her promptly after receipt of his or her notice
of withdrawal and his or her option for the current period will be
automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for the purchase of
shares will be made during the offering period.
 
(b)   Upon termination of the participants
employment prior to the end of the offering period for any reason, including
retirement or death, the payroll deductions credited to his or her account will
be returned to him or her or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or
persons entitled thereto under Section 14, and his or her option will be
automatically terminated.
 
(c)   In the event an Employee fails to remain in
the continuous employ of the Company or one of its Designated Subsidiaries for
at least twenty (20) hours per week during the offering period in which
the employee is a participant, he or she will be deemed to have elected to
withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to his or her
account will be returned to him or her and his or her option terminated.
 
(d)   Except as provided in Section 3(a) with
respect to Section 16 Persons, a participants withdrawal from an offering
will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in a
succeeding offering or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by
the Company. However, a new subscription agreement will have to be filed in
such case.
 
11.   No Interest. No
interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a participant in the Plan.
 
12.   Stock.
 
(a)   The maximum number of shares of the Companys
Common Stock which shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be
seventy million (70,000,000) shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in
capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 18. The shares to be
sold to participants under the Plan may, at the election of the Company, be
either treasury shares or shares authorized but unissued. The maximum number of
shares of the Companys Common Stock available for sale in any offering period
will be established by the committee of the members of the Board administering
the Plan from time to time, prior to an offering period for all options to be
granted during such offering period, subject to adjustment upon changes in
capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 18. If at the
termination of any offering period the total number of shares which would
otherwise be subject to options granted pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof
exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan (after deduction of
all shares for which options have been exercised or are then outstanding), the
Company shall promptly notify the participants, and shall, in its sole
discretion (i) make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining
 
4







 
available for option grant in as
uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be
equitable, (ii) terminate the offering period without issuance of any
shares or (iii) obtain shareholder approval of an increase in the number
of shares authorized under the Plan such that all options could be exercised in
full. The Company may delay determining which of (i), (ii) or
(iii) above it shall decide to effect, and may accordingly delay issuances
of any shares under the Plan, for such time as is necessary to attempt to obtain
shareholder approval of any increase in shares authorized under the Plan. The
Company shall promptly notify participants of its determination to effect (i),
(ii) or (iii) above upon making such decision. A participant may
withdraw all but not less than all the payroll deductions credited to his or
her account under the Plan at any time prior to such notification from the
Company. In the event the Company determines to effect (i) or
(ii) above, it shall promptly upon such determination return to each participant
all payroll deductions not applied towards the purchase of shares.
 
(b)   The participant will have no interest or
voting right in shares covered by his or her option until such option has been
exercised.
 
(c)   Shares to be delivered to a participant under
the Plan will be registered in the name of the participant or in the name of
the participant and the spouse of the participant.
 
13.   Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee
of members of the Board of Directors, which committee shall be appointed by the
Board. The administration, interpretation or application of the Plan by such
committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all participants. Members
of the committee shall not be permitted to participate in the Plan.
 
14.   Designation of Beneficiary.
 
(a)   A participant may indicate in his or her
subscription agreement, or may file a written designation of beneficiary
with respect to, a person who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from
the participants account under the Plan in the event of such participants
death subsequent to the end of the offering period but prior to delivery to him
or her of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a
written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the
participants account under the Plan in the event of such participants death
prior to the end of the offering period.
 
(b)   Such designation of beneficiary may be
changed by the participant at any time by written notice. In the event of the
death of a participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated
under the Plan who is living at the time of such participants death, the
Company shall deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator
of the estate of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator has
been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its
discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or
more dependents or relatives of the participant, or if no spouse, dependent or
relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may
designate.
 
15.   Transferability.  Neither payroll deductions credited to a
participants account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option
or to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the participant. Any
such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be
without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to
withdraw funds in accordance with Section 10.
 
16.   Use of Funds.  All payroll deductions received or held by
the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate
purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll
deductions.
 
5







 
17.   Reports.  Individual accounts will be maintained for
each participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to
participating Employees semi-annually within a reasonable period of time
following the stock purchase date, which statements will set forth the amounts
of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of shares
purchased, the amount of cash rolled over into the next offering period and the
remaining cash balance, if any.
 
18.   Adjustments Upon Changes in
Capitalization.  Subject to
any required action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of
Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been
exercised and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized
for issuance under the Plan but have not yet been placed under option
(collectively, the Reserves), as well as the price per share of Common Stock
covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised, shall
be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of
issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split or the payment of a
stock dividend (but only on the Common Stock) or any other increase or decrease
in the number of shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected
without receipt of consideration. Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock
of any class, or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of stock
of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made
with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an
Option.
 
The Board may, if it so
determines in the exercise of its sole discretion, also make provision for
adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered
by each outstanding option under the Plan, in the event that the Company effects
one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or other
increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding Common Stock, and in the
event of the Company being consolidated with or merged into any other
corporation.
 
19.   Amendment and Termination of
the Plan.
 
(a)   Amendment and
Termination.  The Board may at
any time amend, alter, suspend or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment,
alteration, suspension or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the
rights of any participant under any option theretofore granted without his or
her consent.
 
(b)   Shareholder
Approval.  The Company shall
obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and
desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or with Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor statute or rule or other
applicable law, rule or regulation), such shareholder approval to be obtained
in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law,
rule or regulation.
 
(c)   Effect of
Amendment or Termination.  Any
such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect options already
granted hereunder and such options shall remain in full force and effect as if
this Plan had not been amended or terminated.
 
20.   Notices.  All notices or other communications by a
participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed
to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at
the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt
thereof. All notices or other communications to a participant by the Company
shall be deemed to have been duly given when sent by the Company by regular
mail to the address of the participant on the human resources records of the
Company or when posted on AppleLink or any substitute general electronic
messaging and bulletin board system utilized by the Company.

21.   Conditions Upon Issuance of
Shares.  Shares shall not be
issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the
issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all
applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without
limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the
requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the
shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the
approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
 
As a condition to the exercise of
an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are
being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell
or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a
representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions
of Law.
 
22.   Non-U.S. Employees.  With respect to the Company or any of its
Designated Subsidiaries which employs Participants who reside outside of the
United States, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board
may in its sole discretion amend or vary the terms of the Plan in order to
conform such terms with the requirements of local law to meet the objectives
and purpose of the Plan, and the Board may, where appropriate, establish one or
more sub-plans to reflect such amended or varied provisions.

3.               Stock Subject to the Plan. Subject to the provisions of Section 17 of the Plan, the maximum
aggregate number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan is 145,000,000
Shares. The Shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.
 
Any
Shares subject to Options or SARs shall be counted against the numerical limits
of this Section 3 as one Share for every Share subject thereto. With
respect to Awards granted on or after the date of receiving shareholder
approval of the amended Plan in 2005, any Shares subject to Stock Purchase
Rights, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units with a per share or unit
purchase price lower than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant shall
be counted against the numerical limits of this Section 3 as two Shares
for every one Share subject thereto. To the extent that a Share that was
subject to an Award that counted as two Shares against the Plan reserve
pursuant to the preceding sentence is recycled back into the Plan under the
next paragraph of this Section 3, the Plan shall be credited with two
Shares.
 
If an
Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full,
or, with respect to Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock
Units, is forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, the unpurchased Shares
(or for Awards other than Options and SARs, the forfeited or repurchased
shares) which were subject thereto shall become available for future grant or
sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). With respect to SARs,
when a stock settled SAR is exercised, the Shares subject to a SAR grant
agreement shall be counted against the numerical limits of Section 3
above, as one share for every share subject thereto, regardless of the number
of shares used to settle the SAR 
 
4







 
upon exercise. Shares
that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award shall not be
returned to the Plan and shall not become available for future distribution
under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares of Restricted Stock,
Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units are repurchased by the Company at
their original purchase price or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares
shall become available for future grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the
exercise price of an Option shall not become available for future grant or sale
under the Plan. Shares used to satisfy tax withholding obligations shall not
become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an
Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than stock, such cash payment
shall not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.
Any payout of Dividend Equivalents, because they are payable only in cash,
shall not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.
Conversely, any forfeiture of Dividend Equivalents shall not increase the
number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan.
 
4.               Administration of the Plan.
 
(a)   Procedure.
 
(i)    Multiple Administrative Bodies.
If permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or any
successor rule thereto, as in effect at the time that discretion is being
exercised with respect to the Plan, and by the legal requirements of the
Applicable Laws relating to the administration of stock plans such as the Plan,
if any, the Plan may (but need not) be administered by different administrative
bodies with respect to (a) Directors who are Employees, (b) Officers who
are not Directors, and (c) Employees who are neither Directors nor
Officers.
 
(ii)   Section 162(m).
To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify
Awards granted hereunder as performance-based compensation within the
meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a
Committee of two or more outside directors within the meaning of
Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(iii)  Rule 16b-3. To the extent
desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3,
the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the
requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.
 
(iv)  Other Administration. Other than as
provided above, the Plan shall be administered by (a) the Board or
(b) a Committee, which committee shall be constituted to satisfy
Applicable Laws.
 
(b)   Powers of the Administrator.
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject
to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the
Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion:
 
(i)    to determine
the Fair Market Value;
 
(ii)   to select the
person(s) to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;
 
(iii)  to determine
the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Award granted
hereunder;
 
(iv)  to approve
forms of Award Agreement for use under the Plan;
 
(v)   to determine
the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any
Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited
to, the exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Awards may be
exercised (or are earned) (which may be based on performance criteria), any
vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction
or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating
thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall determine; provided, however, that with respect to Shares of
Restricted Stock subject to Stock Purchase Rights, Performance Shares or
Restricted Stock Units vesting solely 
 
5







 
based
on continuing as an Employee or Chairman, they will vest in full no earlier
(except if accelerated pursuant to Sections 17 or 4(b)(ix) hereof) than
the three (3) year anniversary of the grant date; provided, further, that
if vesting is not solely employment- or Chairmanship-based, they
will vest in full no earlier (except if accelerated pursuant to Sections 17 or
4(b)(ix) hereof) than the one (1) year anniversary of the grant date;
 
(vi)  the
Administrator may not reprice Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights,
including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder
approval.
 
(vii) to construe
and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
 
(viii)to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to
sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment
under foreign tax laws;
 
(ix)   to modify or
amend each Award (subject to Section 19(c) of the Plan), including the
discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of
Options and SARs longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan; however,
the Administrator may not extend the post-termination exercisability period
beyond the earlier of the date the Award would otherwise expire by its terms
due to the passage of time from the date of grant or seven (7) years;
 
(x)    to allow
Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, SAR
or Stock Purchase Right or upon vesting or payout of another Award, that number
of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be
determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be
determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for
this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the
Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
 
(xi)   to determine
whether Awards will be adjusted for Dividend Equivalents;
 
(xii)  to authorize
any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to
effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator; and
 
(xiii) to make all
other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
 
(c)   Effect of Administrators Decision.
The Administrators decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be
final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.
 
5.               Eligibility.
Awards may be granted to Employees and the Chairman. Incentive Stock Options
may be granted only to Employees.
 
6.               No Employment Rights.
Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with
respect to continuing the Participants relationship as an Employee with or
Chairman of the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the
Participants right or the Companys right to terminate such relationship at
any time, with or without cause.
 
6







 
7.               Code Section 162(m) Provisions.
 
(a)   Option and SAR Annual Share Limit.
No Participant shall be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights to purchase more than 34,000,000 Shares.
 
(b)   Restricted Stock Subject to Stock Purchase
Rights, Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit Annual Limit. No
Participant shall be granted, in any Fiscal Year, more than 10,000,000 Shares
in the aggregate of the following: (i) Restricted Stock subject to Stock
Purchase Rights, (ii) Performance Shares, or (iii) Restricted Stock
Units.
 
(c)   Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions.
For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock subject to Stock Purchase
Rights, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units as performance-based
compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its
discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance
Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the
latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock subject to Stock
Purchase Rights, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units to qualify as performance-based
compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted
Stock subject to Stock Purchase Rights, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock
Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the
Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to
be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under
Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
 
(d)   Changes in Capitalization. The
numerical limitations in Sections 7(a) and (b) shall be adjusted
proportionately in connection with any change in the Companys capitalization
as described in Section 18(a).
 
8.               Term of Plan.
Subject to Section 23 of the Plan, the Plan shall continue in effect until
February 8, 2015.
 
9.               Stock Options.
 
(a)   Type of Option. Each Option shall
be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a
Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, not withstanding such designation, to the
extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which
Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant
during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or
Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory
Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 9(a), Incentive Stock Options
shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair
Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with
respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(b)   Term. The term of each Option
shall be seven (7) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as
may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive
Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock
Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any
Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be five
(5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided
in the Award Agreement.
 
(c)   Option Exercise Price and Consideration.
 
(i)    Exercise Price. The per share
exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option
shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of
grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted
to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns
stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all
classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share
exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.
 
7







 
(ii)   Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.
At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within
which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must
be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
 
(iii)  Form of Consideration. The
Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for
exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an
Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form
of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely
of:
 
(1)   cash;
 
(2)   check;
 
(3)   promissory
note;
 
(4)   other Shares
which have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised (which
may include Shares that would otherwise be issued pursuant to the Option);
 
(5)   consideration
received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the
Company in connection with the Plan;
 
(6)   a reduction in
the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability
attributable to the Participants participation in any Company-sponsored
deferred compensation program or arrangement;
 
(7)   any
combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
 
(8)   such other
consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent
permitted by Applicable Laws.
 
10.         Stock Appreciation Rights.
 
(a)   Granted in Connection with Options.
At the sole discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection
with all or any part of an Option, either concurrently with the grant of the
Option or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option. The following
provisions apply to SARs that are granted in connection with Options:
 
(i)    The SAR shall
entitle the Participant to exercise the SAR by surrendering to the Company
unexercised a portion of the related Option. The Participant shall receive in
exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR of the Common Stock covered by
the surrendered portion of the related Option over (y) the exercise price
of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount
that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit
shall not restrict the exercisability of the related Option;
 
(ii)   When a SAR is
exercised, the related Option, to the extent surrendered, shall no longer be
exercisable;
 
(iii)  A SAR shall
be exercisable only when and to the extent that the related Option is
exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on which the related Option
expires; and
 
(iv)  A SAR may only
be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered
by the related Option exceeds the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by
the related Option.
 
8







 
(b)   Independent SARs. At the sole
discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.
The following provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in connection with
Options:
 
(i)    The SAR shall
entitle the Participant, by exercising the SAR, to receive from the Company an
amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date of such exercise,
over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by the
exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date on which the SAR was granted;
provided, however, that the Administrator may place limits on the amount that
may be paid upon exercise of a SAR; and
 
(ii)   SARs shall be
exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as the Administrator shall
specify in the Participants Award Agreement;
 
(iii)  The term of
each SAR shall be seven (7) years from the date of grant or such shorter
term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
 
(c)   Form of Payment. The Companys
obligation arising upon the exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in
cash, or in any combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in
its sole discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR
shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.
 
(d)   Rule 16b-3. SARs granted
hereunder shall contain such additional restrictions as may be required to be
contained in the Plan or Award Agreement in order for the SAR to qualify for
the maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.
 
11.         Exercise of Option or SAR.
 
(a)   Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a
Shareholder. Any Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be
exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such
conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award
Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An
Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
(i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms
of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR,
and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is
exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment
authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the
Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of
the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the
Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by
the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause
to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment
will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior
to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 17 of the
Plan.
 
Exercising
an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter
available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the
number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. Exercise of a SAR in any
manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in a decrease in the
number of Shares which thereafter shall be available for purposes of the Plan,
and the SAR shall cease to be exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.
 
(b)   Termination of Continuous Status as Chairman.
Upon termination of a Participants Continuous Status as Chairman (other than
termination by reason of the Participants death), the Participant may, but
only within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise
his or her Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of
such termination. Notwithstanding 
 
9







 
the
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the
Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time
from the date of grant.
 
(c)   Termination of Continuous Employment.
Upon termination of a Participants Continuous Status as Employee (other than
termination by reason of the Participants death), the Participant may, but
only within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise
his or her Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of
such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may
not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.
 
(d)   Death of Participant. If a
Participant dies (i) while an Employee or Chairman, the Option or SAR may
be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or such other period of
time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator)
following the date of death by the Participants estate or by a person who
acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only
to the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the
Participant continued living and terminated his or her employment six
(6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve
(12) months as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death;
or (ii) within ninety (90) days after the termination of Continuous
Status as an Employee or Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any
time within six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding
twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator) following the date
of death by the Participants estate or by a person who acquired the right to
exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of
the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination. If the
Option or SAR is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option
or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall
revert to the Plan.
 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date
the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of
time from the date of grant.
 
(e)   Buyout Provisions. The
Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares
an Option or SAR previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the
Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time
that such offer is made.
 
12.         Stock Purchase Rights.
 
(a)   Rights to Purchase. Stock Purchase
Rights may be issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other
Awards and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator
determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall
advise the Participant in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions
and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the
Participant shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time
within which the Participant must accept such offer. The offer shall be
accepted by execution of an Award Agreement in the form determined by the
Administrator.
 
(b)   Repurchase Option. Unless the
Administrator determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall grant the Company
a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination
of the purchasers service with the Company for any reason (including death or
Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Award
Agreement shall be the original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by
cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The
repurchase option shall lapse at a rate determined by the Administrator.
 
(c)   Other Provisions. The Award
Agreement shall contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its
sole discretion.
 
10







 
(d)   Rights as a Shareholder. Once the
Stock Purchase Right is exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights
equivalent to those of a shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or
her purchase is entered upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent
of the Company. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for
which the record date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is
exercised, except as provided in Section 17 of the Plan.
 
13.         Restricted Stock Units.
 
(a)   Grant. Restricted Stock Units may
be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the
Administrator. After the Administrator determines that it will grant Restricted
Stock Units under the Plan, it shall advise the Participant in writing or
electronically of the terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant,
including the number of Restricted Stock Units and the form of payout, which,
subject to Section 13(d), may be left to the discretion of the
Administrator.
 
(b)   Vesting Criteria and Other Terms.
The Administrator shall set vesting criteria in its discretion, which,
depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the
number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Participant. The
Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of
Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited
to, continued employment), or any other basis determined by the Administrator
in its discretion.
 
(c)   Earning Restricted Stock Units.
Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant shall be entitled
to receive a payout as specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the grant of Restricted Stock
Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any
vesting criteria that must be met to receive a payout.
 
(d)   Form and Timing of Payment.
Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units shall be made as soon as practicable
after the date(s) set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. The
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in
cash, Shares, or a combination thereof. Shares represented by Restricted Stock
Units that are fully paid in cash again shall be available for grant under the
Plan.
 
(e)   Cancellation. On the date set
forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted
Stock Units shall be forfeited to the Company.
 
14.         Performance Shares.
 
(a)   Grant of Performance Shares.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Shares may be
granted to Participants at any time as shall be determined by the
Administrator, in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 7(b) hereof, the
Administrator shall have complete discretion to determine (i) the number
of Shares subject to a Performance Share award granted to any Participant, and
(ii) the conditions that must be satisfied, which typically will be based
principally or solely on achievement of performance milestones but may include
a service-based component, upon which is conditioned the grant or vesting
of Performance Shares. Performance Shares shall be granted in the form of units
to acquire Shares. Each such unit shall be the equivalent of one Share for purposes
of determining the number of Shares subject to an Award. Until the Shares are
issued, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a
stockholder shall exist with respect to the units to acquire Shares.
 
(b)   Other Terms. The Administrator,
subject to the provisions of the Plan, shall have complete discretion to
determine the terms and conditions of Performance Shares granted under the
Plan. Performance Share grants shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and
restrictions determined by the Administrator at the time the stock is awarded,
which may include such performance-based milestones as are determined
appropriate by the Administrator. The Administrator may require the recipient
to sign a Performance Shares Award Agreement as a condition of the award. Any
certificates 
 
11







 
representing
the Shares of stock awarded shall bear such legends as shall be determined by
the Administrator.
 
(c)   Performance Share Award Agreement.
Each Performance Share grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that
shall specify such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall determine.
 
15.         Transferability of Awards.
Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold,
pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner
other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title 1 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be exercised, during the
lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator
makes an Award transferable, such Award shall contain such additional terms and
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
 
16.         Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax Obligations. When a Participant incurs tax liability in connection with the
exercise, vesting or payout, as applicable, of an Award, which tax liability is
subject to tax withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Participant is
obligated to pay the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable
tax laws, the Participant may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by
electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon
exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right or the Shares to be issued
upon payout or vesting of the other Award, if any, that number of Shares having
a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The Fair
Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that
the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (the Tax Date).
 
All
elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be
made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject
to the following restrictions:
 
(a)   the election
must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date; and
 
(b)   all elections
shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of the Administrator.
 
In the
event the election to have Shares subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right withheld is made by a Participant and the Tax Date is deferred under
Section 83 of the Code because no election is filed under
Section 83(b) of the Code, the Participant shall receive the full number
of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right is
exercised but such Participant shall be unconditionally obligated to tender
back to the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.
 
17.         Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution,
Merger or Asset Sale.
 
(a)   Changes in Capitalization. Subject
to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares
of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Award and the number of shares of
Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to
which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan
upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, as well as the price per share, if
any, of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Award and the 162(m)
fiscal year share issuance limits under Sections 7(a) and (b) hereof
shall, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the
number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of
Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided,
however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Such
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect
shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no
issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities
convertible into 
 
12







 
shares
of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall
be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject
to an Award.
 
(b)   Dissolution or Liquidation. In the
event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all
outstanding Awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such
proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The
Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right
to exercise his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right until ten
(10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered
thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be
exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company
repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse
100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed
dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner
contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised (with respect
to Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights) or vested (with respect to other
Awards), an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such
proposed action.
 
(c)   Merger or Asset Sale. Unless
otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event of a merger of the
Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of
the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an
equivalent award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or
Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor
corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant
shall (i) fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option, SAR or
Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to
which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, and (ii) fully earn
and receive a payout with respect to other Awards. If an Award becomes fully
vested and exercisable (or earned, as applicable) in lieu of assumption or
substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator
shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that (i) the
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully vested and exercisable for a
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option,
SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period
and (ii) the other Award shall be paid out immediately prior to the merger
or sale of assets. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Award shall be
considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the assumed
Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock
subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received
in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held
on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice
of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration
received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the
successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of
the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon
the exercise (or payout or vesting, as applicable) of the Award, for each Share
of Awarded Stock subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the
successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of
assets.
 
(d)   Change in Control. In the event of
a Change in Control of the Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below,
unless otherwise determined by the Administrator prior to the occurrence of
such Change in Control, the following acceleration and valuation provisions
shall apply:
 
(i)    Any Options,
SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the date such Change in
Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and vested
on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested; and
 
(ii)   Any other
Awards outstanding as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have
occurred that are not yet earned on such date shall become fully earned and
vested; and
 
13







 
(iii)  The value of
all outstanding Awards shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator
at or after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options, SARs and
Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of
(x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right, and the amount at which such other Awards shall be cashed out shall be
equal to the Change in Control price (as defined below). The cash-out proceeds
shall be paid to the Participant or, in the event of death of a Participant
prior to payment, to the estate of the Participant or to a person who acquired
the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or who acquired
the right to receive the payout of the other Award, by bequest or inheritance.
 
(e)   Definition of Change in Control.
For purposes of this Section 17, a Change in Control means the happening
of any of the following:
 
(i)    When any person,
as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other
than the Company, a Subsidiary or a Company employee benefit plan, including
any trustee of such plan acting as trustee) is or becomes the beneficial owner
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly,
of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the
combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities; or
 
(ii)   The
occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval, and involving the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of
the Company with or into another corporation (other than the Companys
reincorporation into another jurisdiction).
 
(f)    Change in Control Price. For
purposes of this Section 17, Change in Control Price shall be, as
determined by the Administrator, (i) the highest Fair Market Value at any
time within the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of determination
of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator (the 60-Day Period), or
(ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined by the
Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer related to the
Change in Control of the Company, at any time within the 60-Day Period.
 
18.         Date of Grant. The
date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the
Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later
date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall
be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such
grant.
 
19.         Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
 
(a)   Amendment and Termination. The
Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
 
(b)   Shareholder Approval. The Company
shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary
and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
 
(c)   Effect of Amendment or Termination.
No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair
the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the
Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and
signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not
affect the Administrators ability to exercise the powers granted to it
hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of
such termination.
 
20.         Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.
 
(a)   Legal Compliance. Shares shall not
be issued pursuant to the exercise or payout, as applicable, of an Award unless
the exercise or payout, as applicable, of such Award and the issuance 
 
14







 
and
delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further
subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.
 
(b)   Investment Representations. As a
condition to the exercise or payout, as applicable, of an Award, the Company
may require the person exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or
in the case of another Award, the person receiving the payout, to represent and
warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased
only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute
such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a
representation is required.
 
21.         Inability to Obtain Authority. The
inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having
jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be
necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall
relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell
such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
 
22.         Reservation of Shares. The
Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any
employee who is resident outside of the United States, the Committee may, in
its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan in order to conform such terms
with the requirements of local law or to meet the objectives of the Plan. The
Committee may, where appropriate, establish one or more sub-plans for this
purpose.

for the Performance Period were achieved or exceeded. The Award for each
Participant shall be determined by applying the Payout Formula to the level of
actual performance that has been certified by the Committee. Notwithstanding

eliminate or reduce the Award payable to any Participant below that which
otherwise would be payable under the Payout Formula.
 
(b)   Right to Receive Payment. Each
Award under the Plan shall be paid solely from the general assets of the
Company. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to create a trust or to
establish or evidence any Participants claim of any right to payment of an
Award other than as an unsecured general creditor with respect to any payment
to which he or she may be entitled.
 
(c)   Form of Distributions. The Company
shall distribute all Awards to the Participant in cash.
 
(d)   Timing of Distributions. Subject
to Section 8(e) below, the Company shall distribute amounts payable to
Participants as soon as is practicable following the determination and written
certification of the Award for a Performance Period, but in no event later than
90 days after the end of the applicable Performance Period.

payment of Awards, or any portion thereof, to Covered Employees as the
Committee, in its discretion, determines to be necessary or desirable to
preserve the deductibility of such amounts under Section 162(m). In
addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to
defer receipt of the payment of cash that would otherwise be delivered to a
Participant under the Plan. Any such deferral elections shall be subject to
such rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
9.               Term of Plan. The
Plan shall first apply to the Companys 2005 Plan Year. The Plan shall
terminate with respect to the 2005 Plan Year and all subsequent Plan Years
unless it is approved at the 2005 annual meeting of the Companys shareholders.
Once approved by the Companys shareholders, the Plan shall continue until
terminated under Section 10 of the Plan.
 
10.         Amendment and Termination of the Plan. The Committee may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan, in
whole or in part, at any time, including the adoption of amendments deemed
necessary or desirable to correct any defect or to supply omitted data or to
reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award granted hereunder;
provided, however, that no amendment, alteration, suspension or discontinuation
shall be made which would (i) impair any payments to Participants made
prior to such amendment, modification, suspension or termination, unless the
Committee has made a determination that such amendment or modification is in
the best interests of all persons to whom Awards have theretofore been granted;
provided further, however, that in no event may such an amendment or
modification result in an increase in the amount of compensation payable
pursuant to such Award or (ii) cause compensation that is, or may become,
payable hereunder to fail to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation.
To the extent necessary or advisable under applicable law, including
Section 162(m), Plan amendments shall be subject to shareholder approval.
At no time before the actual distribution of funds to Participants under the
Plan shall any Participant accrue any vested interest or right whatsoever under
the Plan except as otherwise stated in this Plan.
 
11.         Withholding.
Distributions pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to all applicable federal
and state tax and withholding requirements.
 
12.         At-Will Employment. No
statement in this Plan should be construed to grant any employee an employment
contract of fixed duration or any other contractual rights, nor should this
Plan be 
 
4







 
interpreted
as creating an implied or an expressed contract of employment or any other
contractual rights between the Company and its employees. The employment
relationship between the Company and its employees is terminable at-will. This
means that an employee or the Company may terminate the employment relationship
at any time and for any reason or no reason.
 
13.         Successors. All
obligations of the Company under the Plan, with respect to awards granted
hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the
existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase,
merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Company.
 
14.         Indemnification. Each
person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or of the Board,
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from
(a) any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any
claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in
which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act
under the Plan or any award, and (b) from any and all amounts paid by him
or her in settlement thereof, with the Companys approval, or paid by him or
her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, or
proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an
opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she
undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing
right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification
to which such persons may be entitled under the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or
under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them
harmless.
 
15.         Nonassignment. The
rights of a Participant under this Plan shall not be assignable or transferable
by the Participant except by will or the laws of intestacy.
 
16.         Governing Law. The
Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.
