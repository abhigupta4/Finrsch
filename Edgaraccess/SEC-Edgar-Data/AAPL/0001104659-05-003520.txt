APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Apple
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures and
markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals and
networking solutions.  The Company also
designs, develops and markets a line of portable digital music players along with
related accessories and services including the online distribution of
third-party music and audio books.   The
Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail
stores, its direct sales force and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value
added resellers.  In addition to its own
hardware, software and peripheral products, the Company sells a variety of
third-party hardware and software products through its online and retail
stores.  The Company sells to education,
consumer, creative professional, business and government customers. 
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Interim
information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Companys management,
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of
interim periods presented have been included.  The results for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire
year.  Certain prior year amounts in
these condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.
 
These
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be
read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2004, included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004 (the 2004
Form 10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters
refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters of those fiscal years.
 
Research
and Development
Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer
software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization
beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed. In most instances, the Companys products are released
soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, costs
incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not
significant, and generally all software development costs have been expensed. 
 
In
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began incurring substantial development
costs associated with the upcoming upgrade of Mac OS X version 10.4 (code-named
Tiger).  Tiger enhances the features
and functionality of the previous version of Mac OS X. Tiger achieved
technological feasibility following its public demonstration in August 2004 and
the subsequent release of a developer beta version of the product. Therefore,
during the first quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
capitalized approximately $14.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of
costs associated with the development of Tiger. 
Amortization of this asset will commence when Tiger begins shipping and
will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a 3 year estimated useful
life.  The planned release of the final
version of the product is expected in the first half of calendar year 2005.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share-Based Payment, that addresses the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for
(a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on
the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. 
SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to
 
5







 
Employees, and generally would require instead that such transactions be
accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company is currently
evaluating SFAS 123R to determine which fair-value-based model and transitional
provision it will follow upon adoption. The options for transition methods as
prescribed in SFAS 123R include either
the modified prospective or the modified retrospective methods.
The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded
for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service is
rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption, while the modified
retrospective method would record compensation expense for stock options and
restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. Under the modified
retrospective method, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of
the year of adoption or for all periods presented.  SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company
beginning in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the
application of SFAS 123R, management expects adoption to have a material impact
on its results of operations.
 
The
Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion
No. 25. The Company applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure as if the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense.
Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
 
As
required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation
on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted
and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been estimated at the
date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the
options vesting period and the shares plan period.
 
The
Companys pro forma information for the three month periods ended December 25,
2004 and December 27, 2003 follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

Earnings Per Share
Basic
earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include
the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options, restricted stock and restricted
stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the
treasury stock method.  Under the
treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys
common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options,
restricted
 
6







 
stock
and restricted stock units. 
Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of
restricted stock and restricted stock units can result in a greater dilutive
effect on earnings per share. 
 
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive.

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of
investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities,
and foreign securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist
primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits and
corporate debt securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign
institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses, net of
taxes, of $5 million and $4 million on its investment portfolio, primarily
related to investments with stated maturities less than 1 year, as of December
25, 2004 and September 25, 2004, respectively.
The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated
maturities. No material gains or losses were recognized on any such sales
during either the first quarter of 2005 or 2004. 
 
7







 
As
of December 25, 2004, and September 25, 2004, $449 million and $180 million,
respectively, of the Companys investment portfolio that was classified as
short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years.  The remainder of the Companys short-term
investments had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The
Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign
exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option contracts
are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing assets and
liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash
flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to time, the
Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to modify the interest
rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting policies
for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as
hedge or non-hedge instruments. As of the end of the first quarter of 2005, the
general nature of the Companys risk management activities and the general
nature and mix of the Companys derivative financial instruments have not
changed materially from the end of fiscal 2004.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The
Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with
financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with
existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and
forecasted future cash flows. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures.
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.
 
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
The
Company accounts for all derivatives at fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be
offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As of December 25, 2004, the
Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $12.8 million net of taxes, substantially all of which is
expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the third quarter of
fiscal 2005.

Note 5  Shareholders Equity
 
Preferred Stock
The
Company has 5 million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is
outstanding. Under the terms of the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors
is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions of the Companys
authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In
July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company
to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time.  The Company
has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock since fiscal
2003. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased
a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company was
authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock
as of December 25, 2004.
 
Comprehensive
Income
Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income.
Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that
under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of
shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from
those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency,
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative
instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note 6  Employee Benefit Plans 
 
2003
Employee Stock Option Plan
At
the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders
approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the
name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to
provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive
officers and other key employees and to prohibit future repricings of
employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs,
without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants,
options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the
grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on
continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan
permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,
restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. 
 
1997
Employee Stock Option Plan
In
August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee
Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants
of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the
terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of
amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company
terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
 
11







 
remaining
unissued shares totaling 14,295,351 following the completion of an employee
stock option exchange program in October 2003.
 
1997
Director Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee
directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest
in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of
the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully
vested at grant. 
 
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain
of the Companys executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Peter
Oppenheimer, Mr. Jonathan Rubinstein, Dr. Bertrand Serlet, and Dr. Avadis
Tevanian, Jr., have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
Companys stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and
shares acquired pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan and upon
vesting of restricted stock units.
 
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan
The
Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase
Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock
through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering periods. Stock
purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees
compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of
shares authorized for issuance is limited to a total of 1 million shares per
offering period. As of December 25, 2004, approximately 1.4 million shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

The
Company had 2.515 million restricted stock units outstanding as of December 25,
2004, which were excluded from the options outstanding balances in the
preceding tables.  None of these
restricted stock units were vested as of December 25, 2004. The grant of these
restricted stock units has been deducted from the shares available for grant
under the Companys stock option plans.
 
Note 7  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The
Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock
compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and employee
stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at
the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. 
 
The
assumptions used for the three month periods ended December 25, 2004 and
December 27, 2003, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair
value per share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods

Note 8  Commitments and Contingencies
 
Lease
Commitments
The
Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under
noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently
utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major facility
leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for
terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to
16 years and often contain multi-year renewal options.
 
13







 
As
of September 25, 2004, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $617 million, of which $436 million related
to leases for retail space.  As of
December  25, 2004, total future minimum
lease payments related to leases for retail space increased to $450 million.
 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The
Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware
products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year
from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day
basic warranty for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products.
The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is
recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product
warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject
to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company
assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the
amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future
expectations.
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys accrued
warranties and related costs for the three month periods ended December 25,
2004 and December 27, 2003 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its
operating system and application software against legal claims that the
software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements
entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential
liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for
infringement costs as of either December 25, 2004 or September 25, 2004.
 
Contingencies
Beginning
on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. These lawsuits are
substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of persons who
purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between July 19,
2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the 1934
Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was
heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the
Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of
action, with leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days.
Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on
March 17, 2003, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint. The Court heard the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and
dismissed Plaintiffs claims with prejudice on August 12, 2003. Plaintiffs
have appealed the ruling.  The parties
have fully briefed the appeal and a hearing is set for February 17, 2005.
 
The
Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have
arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated.
In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability
related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or
in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
liquidity or results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any
of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company
settled certain matters
 
14







 
during
the first quarter of 2005, which did not individually or in the aggregate have
a material impact on the Companys results of operations.
 
Production
and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the
Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances,
the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end
of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal
or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been
passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S.  Although the Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations
and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or
future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
operations and financial position.
 
Note 9 - Segment Information and Geographic Data 
 
In
accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company
reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys
reportable segments.
 
The
Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys
reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and
Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include
activities related to the Retail segment. 
The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe
segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The
Japan segment includes only Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned
retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. 
Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia
and Asia except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various
segments are the same as those described in the Companys 2004 10-K in Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, except as described below for the
Retail segment.
 
The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales.
The Retail segments performance is also evaluated based on operating income.
Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of the
customers. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third
parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to
the segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and
expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments.
Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate
expenses, manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs,
income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, manufacturing costs and
variances not included in standard costs, and other separately managed general
and administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated
with support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets
exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and
long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate
infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the
Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $33
million and $28 million during the first quarters of 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
 
Operating
income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of sales at manufacturing
standard cost, other cost of sales, related sales and marketing costs, and
certain general and administrative costs. This measure of operating income,
which includes manufacturing profit, provides a comparable basis for comparison
between the Companys various geographic segments.  Certain manufacturing expenses and related
adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between
standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for
product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses. 
 
Management
assesses the operating performance of the Retail segment differently than it
assesses the operating performance of the Companys geographic segments. The
Retail segment revenue and operating income is intended
 
15







 
to
depict a comparable measure to that of the Companys major channel partners in
the U.S. operating retail stores so the Company can evaluate the Retail segment
performance as if it were a channel partner. Therefore, the Company makes three
significant adjustments to the Retail segment for management reporting purposes
that are not included in the results of the Companys other segments. 
 
First,
the Retail segments operating income includes cost of sales for Apple products
at an amount normally charged to major channel partners in the U.S. operating
retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those
channel partners and the Companys cost to support those partners. For the
first quarter of 2005 and 2004, this resulted in the recognition of additional
cost of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting
benefit to corporate expenses of approximately $99 million and $52 million,
respectively.
 
Second,
the Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts are transferred
to the Retail segment at the same cost as that charged to the Companys major
retail channel partners in the U.S., resulting in a comparable measure of
revenue and gross margin between the Companys Retail stores and those retail
channel partners.  The Retail segment
recognizes the full amount of revenue and cost of sales at the time of sale of
the Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts. Because the
Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the costs associated with
the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts is recognized in other
operating segments net sales and cost of sales.  For the first quarter of 2005, this resulted
in the recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in other operating segments, of $19 million and $13
million, respectively. For the first quarter of 2004, the net sales and cost of
sales recognized by the Retail segment for sales of extended warranty, support
and service contracts were $12 million and $8 million, respectively. 
 
Third,
the Company has opened seven high profile stores in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan, Osaka, Japan, and London, England as of
December 25, 2004.  These high profile
stores are larger than the Companys typical retail stores and were designed to
further promote brand awareness and provide a venue for certain corporate sales
and marketing activities, including corporate briefings.  As such, the Company allocates certain
operating expenses associated with these stores to corporate marketing expense
to reflect the estimated benefit realized Company-wide. The allocation of these
operating costs is based on the excess amount incurred for a high profile store
to that of a more typical Company retail location. Expenses allocated to
corporate marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $6.9
million and $2.2 million in the first quarters of 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Note 10  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other
Transactions
 
In
March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with its CEO,
Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in
the operation of his private plane when used for Apple business.  The Reimbursement Agreement became effective
for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes since he took
delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total of $419,000
and $282,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement during the
first quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. All expenses recognized pursuant
to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in selling, general, and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
Mr. Jerome
York, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a member of an
investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in
January 2000. Until September 7, 2003, he also served as Microwarehouses
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse was a reseller of computer hardware, software and
peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On
September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW) acquired selected North American assets of MicroWarehouse.
MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the
U.S. MicroWarehouse accounted for 0.3% and 0.4% of the Companys
net sales in the first quarter of 2005 and 2004, respectively. Trade
receivables from MicroWarehouse were $0.2 million and $4.3 million as of
December 25, 2004 and September 25, 2004, respectively.  During the first 
 
17







 
quarter
of 2005, the Company wrote off $4.1 million of MicroWarehouse trade
receivables, which were previously fully reserved.  The Company has provided what it believes to
be an adequate allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Companys
secured interest position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected
payments to unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade
receivables were generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those
with the Companys other resellers.

Executive Overview
Apple
designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related software,
services, peripherals and networking solutions. 
The Company also designs, develops and markets a line of portable
digital music players along with related accessories and services including the
online distribution of third-party music and audio books. The Companys
products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook
computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID
storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software
applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the online iTunes Music Store, a
portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod
product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The
Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail
stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and
value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party
Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing
supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital video and still cameras,
personal digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies
through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer,
creative professional, business and government customers.  A further description of the Companys
products may be found below and in Part I, Item 1 of the Companys 2004 Form
10-K.
 
The
Companys business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and
development of its own operating system, hardware and many software
applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world
compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless
integration and innovative industrial design. 

 
The
Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal
computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its
iPod line of digital music players and distribution of third-party digital
music through its online iTunes Music Store. 
While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal
computer market as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of
digital music, these are highly competitive markets that are subject to
aggressive pricing and increased competition. 
In order to remain competitive, the Company believes that increased
investment in research and development (R&D) and marketing and advertising
is necessary in order to maintain and extend its position in the markets where
it competes.  The Companys R&D
spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its
existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software
applications and portable music players; developing new digital lifestyle
consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product
areas such as rack-mount
 
19







 
servers,
RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies.  The Company also believes that investment in
marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand
awareness.
 
The
Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels.  The Company believes that sales of its
innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable
salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software and peripheral
integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are
available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the seamless
compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks.  The Company further believes that providing a
high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting
and retaining customers.  To ensure a
high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education
are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution
capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and
internationally.  The Company had 101
stores open as of December 25, 2004.
 
The
Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Companys own
employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels.  The Company has deployed Apple employees in
reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan and
Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online
stores around the world.
 
To
improve the accessibility to its iPod product line, the Company has
significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold.
The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores,
member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates
that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Companys 2004 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such
differences may be material.
 
Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and
estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase
commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles,
warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial
condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures
with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.
 
Revenue Recognition
Net
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of products (e.g., hardware,
software, music products, and peripherals), and extended warranty and support
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting
standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended,
and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
No. 104, Revenue Recognition.
 
The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection
is probable.  Generally, product is
considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and
risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to
individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
other sales, the Company defers revenue recognition until the customer receives
the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss
on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company
determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or
determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become
due and payable.
 
20







 
The
Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to
price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and
end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives.  The estimated cost of these programs is accrued
as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and
committed to a plan.  The Company also
records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the
Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product
transitions may require the Company to
increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection
obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time
such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs
require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem
the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and
conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion
of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record
additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on
the Companys results of operations.
 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company distributes its products through third-party
resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial
customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers. However, when
possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables
with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe and Asia
and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring
arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct
customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the
third-party financing company and the end customer.  As such, the Company generally does not
assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these
arrangements. However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring
arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys
distribution and retail channel partners.
 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer
accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial
condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific
receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible.  The Company also records an allowance for all
other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical
experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial
condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such
receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial
condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to
the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on
trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the
Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would
affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.
 
Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments
The Company must order components for its products and
build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party
products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of
anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed
review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including
demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans,
current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer
and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable
pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future
demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than
forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility
of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional
write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the
write-downs are recorded.
 
The Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation
fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the
Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These
commitments typically cover the Companys
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and
substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an
unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys
products, the Company may be
required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would
negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are
identified.
 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
Including Acquired Intangibles
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and
certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be
recoverable.
 
21







 
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison
of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are
expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying
value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has
recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant,
and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years,
except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in
the Companys business in a geographic region or business segment in the
future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores,
could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such
business issues are identified.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performs a review of goodwill for
impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.
The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and
requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various reporting units of the
Companys business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value
of those reporting units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company
determine the book value of those reporting units. If the estimated fair value
of reporting units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their
book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all
identifiable assets and liabilities of those reporting units in a manner similar
to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires
independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets
including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once
this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be
determined. 
 
Based on the Companys estimates as of December 25, 2004 there was
no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including
changes in the Companys market capitalization, changes in the Companys
forecasts, and changes in the Companys internal business structure could cause
one or more of the Companys reporting units to be valued differently thereby
causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the
personal computer and consumer electronics industries and changes in global or
regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its
resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting
businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and
equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill.
 
Warranty Costs
The
Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the
time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical
and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that
are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter,
the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded
warranty liabilities considering the size
of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and
adjusts the amounts as necessary.  If actual product failure rates or repair
costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability
would be required and could negatively
affect the Companys results of operations.
 
Income Taxes
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax
consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability
method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that
apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.  The Company is
currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004, which if implemented by the Company, would affect the Companys
tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax
planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax
liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax
assets.  In the event that all or part of
the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future,
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the
period such determination is made. 
Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that
were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation
allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or
a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made.  In addition, the
 
22







 
calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in
estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax
laws.  Resolution of these uncertainties
in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position.

Net sales during the
first quarter of 2005 increased 74% or $1.484 billion from the same quarter in
2004.  Several factors contributed to
this increase including:
 
      Net
sales of iPods rose $955 million or 373% during the first quarter of 2005
compared to the year-ago quarter. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.6 million in
the first quarter of 2005, which represents an increase of 525% from the
733,000 iPod units sold in the year-ago quarter and exceeded the total number
of iPods shipped in all of fiscal year 2004. 
Strong iPod demand during the first quarter of 2005 continued to be
experienced by all of the Companys operating segments and was driven by
several factors, including the introduction of the iPod photo and U2 special
edition iPod during October 2004; better supply of critical iPod components;
and increased expansion of the Companys iPod distribution network. Since
inception of the iPod product line in fiscal 2002, the Company has sold in
excess of 10 million iPods.
 
      Net sales of Macintosh systems increased
$336 million or 26% during the first quarter of 2005 compared to 2004; while
unit sales of Macintosh systems increased by 217,000 units or 26% during the
first quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago quarter. These increases in net
sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for the Companys
consumer-oriented products, including the iMac and iBook. Net sales and unit
sales of these consumer-oriented systems accounted for 57% and 70%,
respectively of all Macintosh systems sold during the first quarter of
2005.  Net sales of iMac and iBook
increased 147% and 34%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2005 compared
to the year-ago quarter.  Unit sales
showed year-over-year increases of 101% and 35% for iMac and iBook,
respectively.  Strong results of the iMac
were attributable to the introduction of the iMac G5 in September 2004 and
increased availability of iMac G5 components in the first quarter of 2005,
which also resulted in an increase in channel inventory to within the Companys
typical range.  The Companys iBook sales
were also strong in the first quarter of 2005 due to the introduction of
upgraded iBooks in October 2004 and holiday demand.  The Companys average net sales per Macintosh
unit sold remained flat on a year-over-year basis as a result of changes in
overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced products, offset by an
increase in direct sales.
 
      The Retail segments net sales grew to
$561 million during the first quarter of 2005 from $273 million during the same
period in 2004, a 105% increase. 
Macintosh unit sales increased 63% year-over-year in the first quarter
of 2005.  These increases are largely
attributable to the increase in total stores from 73 stores at the end of the
first quarter of 2004 to 101 stores at the end of the first quarter of 2005, as
well as a 48% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the
Companys customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may
elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Companys
preexisting sales channels in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K., the Company
believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales is
incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below
related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating Performance.
 
      Other music products consists
of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod related services and
accessories.  Net sales of other music
products increased $130 million or 277% during the first quarter of 2005
compared to the year-ago quarter. The Company has experienced strong growth in
sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall
iPod unit sales for the first quarter of 2005. The year-over-year increase in
sales from the iTunes Music Store relates to overall growth in the U.S. market
and expanded availability of the iTunes Music store service, which in the first
quarter of 2005 served 14 countries in North America and Europe compared to
availability only in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2004.
 
      Net sales of peripherals and other
hardware rose by 28% during the first quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago
quarter primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other
computer accessories.  Net sales of other
computer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital
video cameras, and third-party hardware products. The increase in total net
sales of peripherals and other hardware is related to the overall increase in
Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral
products and was experienced predominantly by the Companys Americas, Europe,
and Retail segments.
 
      The Company experienced year-over-year
improvement in its U.S. education channel during the first quarter of 2005 with
net sales and unit sales increasing by approximately 20% and 11%, respectively,
from the same quarter in 2004.  Net sales
generated in U.S. education for the first quarter of 2005 yielded the
 
26







 
highest
first quarter revenue level from this channel in 7 years.  Net sales from both the higher education and
K-12 markets showed strong growth of 25% and 15%, respectively, in the first
quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago quarter.  These positive results were due in part to
strong demand for the Companys iMac G5 and iBook products.
 
      Service and other sales had a
year-over-year increase of $33 million or 52% during the first quarter of 2005
compared to the same period in 2004. 
These increases are the result of significant year-over-year increases
in net sales associated with AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended
maintenance and support services, as well as increases in net sales associated
with the Companys .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with
APP are primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach
rates on APP over the last several years.
 
Offsetting the favorable
factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during the first quarter of
2005 were negatively impacted by the following:
 
      Net sales and unit sales of the Companys
professional-oriented products, including the Power Macintosh and PowerBook,
declined in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the year-ago quarter.   The Companys Power Macintosh net sales and
unit sales declined 4% and 19%, respectively, while PowerBook net sales and
unit sales declined 23% and 22%, respectively. 
The year-over-year decline in Power Macintosh is partially attributable
to strong sales in the first quarter of 2004, which was the first full quarter
of sales for the new Power Mac G5 that had been introduced at the end of the
fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, the Company believes that the Power
Macintosh decline in the first quarter of 2005 may have resulted from a shift
in customer preference away from the single processor Power Mac G5 towards the
iMac G5.   The decline in PowerBooks is
believed to be attributable in part to a shift to the new iBooks, which were
announced in October 2004.  The Company
believes such movement between its product lines is typical after new product
introductions.
 
      Net sales of software decreased $32
million or 21% during the first quarter of 2005 compared to the same period in
2004 due primarily to higher net sales in the first quarter of 2004 that
resulted from the October 2003 release of Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther, the
Companys current operating system software, partially offset by an increase in
application software net sales.   Net
sales of Panther have been trending downward as customers await the upcoming
release of Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger, which is expected to be released by
the Company in the first half of fiscal 2005.
 
Segment
Operating Performance
The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable
operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail.
The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities
related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and
South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the
Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan.  The Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned
retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. Each reportable geographic
operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments may be
found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and
Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment during the first quarter of 2005
increased $713 million or 77% compared to the same quarter in 2004, while unit
sales increased 26% year-over year.  This
increase was driven primarily by increased demand of the iPod as well as strong
sales of the Companys consumer-oriented iMac and iBook products. During the
first quarters of 2005 and 2004, the Americas segment represented approximately
47% and 46%, respectively, of the Companys total net sales. As noted above,
the Company experienced a year-over-year increase in its U.S. education channel
net sales of 20% and related CPU unit growth of 11% in the first quarter of
2005 compared to the same period in the prior year. Year-over-year increases in
higher education and K-12 net sales of 25% and 15%, respectively, were due in
part to strong demand for the Companys iMac G5 and iBooks.
 
27







 
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased $328 million or 63% during the first
quarter of 2005 as compared to the same quarter in 2004.  Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe
increased 33% on a year-over-year basis. 
Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced similar
strength in its consumer-oriented iPod, iMac and iBook products. The Europe
segment also experienced strong sales of peripherals and other hardware,
including sales of Apple-branded and third-party displays and other hardware
accessories.
 
Japan
Japans net sales increased 18% to $185 million during the first
quarter of 2005 from $157 million in the same quarter in 2004. The increase in
total net sales for the Japan segment was the result of strong iPod and iMac
sales during the first quarter of 2005, partially offset by weak demand for the
Companys Power Macintosh, PowerBook and iBook products as well as lower sales
of software.  Macintosh unit sales in the
Japan segment were down 17% in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the
year-ago quarter. The relatively poor performance of the Japan segment in the
first quarter of 2005, specifically a unit sales decline and lower net sales
growth relative to the rest of the Companys operating segments, may in part
relate to a shift in sales from the Japan Segment to the Retail segment as a
result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in fiscal 2004. When net sales
from the Japan retail stores are added in the results for the Japan segment,
the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 26% year-over-year increase in
first quarter of 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004.  The Company has implemented several channel
improvements, which it believes will improve the performance of the Japan segment
in the future.
 
Retail
During the first quarter
of 2005, the Company opened fifteen new retail stores, including its third
international store, which is located in London, England. In addition,
approximately half of the stores opened during the first quarter were in the
new mini store design, which is the Companys smallest store format to
date.  The Company had 101 retail stores
open at the end of the first quarter of 2005 compared to 73 open stores at the
end of the first quarter of 2004.  During
the first quarter of 2005, the Retail segments net sales grew to $561 million
as compared to $273 million in the same period in 2004, a 105% increase.  With an average of 95 stores open during the
quarter, average quarterly revenue per store increased 48% to $5.9 million in
the first quarter of 2005, up from $4.0 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
As measured by the
Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported a profit of
$45 million during the first quarter of 2005 compared to a profit of $9 million
during the same period in 2004. This improvement in profitability is primarily
attributable to the segments year-over-year increase in average quarterly
revenue per store, the impact of the opening of 28 new stores, and the segments
year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on
occupancy, depreciation and other fixed costs.
 
Expansion of the Retail
segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in
fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel,
and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail
segment since its inception totaled $394 million through the end of fiscal
2004, and totaled $33 million during the first quarter of 2005.
 
As of December 25,
2004, the Retail segment had approximately 2,675 employees and had outstanding
lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of
$450 million.

Gross margin for
the first quarter of 2005 was 28.5% compared to 26.7% for the same quarter in
2004. The year-over-year increase in gross margin during the first quarter of
2005 was primarily due to the following factors, including more favorable
pricing on certain commodity components, higher revenue which provided for
strong leveraging of fixed production costs and a more favorable mix of direct
sales.  In addition, gross margin during the
 
28







 
first
quarter of 2004 was lower than usual primarily due to pricing actions on
certain Power Mac G5 models that were transitioned in that quarter and purchase
order cancellation costs associated with those product transitions.
 
The Company
expects gross margin to be approximately 125 basis points lower in the second
quarter of 2005 than in the first quarter of 2005 primarily due to expected
lower revenue which will provide less leverage on fixed production costs; lower
pricing on certain products; and sales of the iPod shuffle and Mac mini which
have lower gross margins than other products in their respective product
families.
 
The foregoing
statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin and forecasted revenue
for the second quarter of 2005 are forward-looking. Gross margin could differ
from anticipated levels because of several factors, including certain of those
set forth below in the subsection entitled Factors That May Affect Future
Results and Financial Condition. There can be no assurance that current gross
margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or
current margins on existing individual products will be maintained.

Research
and Development (R&D)
Expenditures for
R&D increased 3% or $4 million to $123 million in the first quarter of 2005
compared to $119 million in the same quarter of 2004 due primarily to an
increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D
activities.  In addition, during the
first quarter of 2005, the Company capitalized approximately $14.8 million of
costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Tiger.  No software development costs were capitalized
during the first quarter of 2004.  The
decrease in R&D as a percentage of net sales to 4% in the first quarter of
2005 from 6% in the first quarter of 2004 is due to the significant 74%
increase in total net sales for the Company in the first quarter of 2005.  The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive
position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of
new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business
strategy.  As such, the Company expects
continued heavy R&D investment for further innovation to remain
competitive.
 
Selling,
General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)
SG&A increased
37% or $127 million to $470 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared to
$343 million in the same quarter of 2004. This increase is due primarily to
higher direct and channel variable selling expenses resulting from the
significant year-over-year increase in total net sales for the first quarter,
the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and
international markets, and a current year increase in discretionary spending on
marketing and advertising.

Gains on
Non-current Investments
During the first
quarter of 2004, the Company sold its remaining non-current investments in
public companies consisting of 986,164 shares of Akamai Technologies for net
proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain before taxes of $4 million. As
of December 25, 2004, the Company does not have any non-current public company
investments reflected in its condensed consolidated balance sheet.
 
Interest
and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other income, net, increased $17 million to
$26 million during the first quarter of 2005 compared to $9 million in the
comparable quarter of 2004. This increase is attributable primarily to higher
cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields
resulting from higher market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate
earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
increased to 1.93% in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the 1.27% earned
during the same period in 2004. The Company occasionally sells short-term
investments prior to their stated maturities. No gains or losses were
recognized on any such sales during either the first quarter of 2005 or 2004.
 
Interest expense in the
prior year consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million
aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their
maturity in February 2004, partially offset by amortization of deferred gains
realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from the closure of swap positions
associated with the unsecured notes.
 
Provision
for Income Taxes
The Companys
effective tax rate for the first three months of 2005 was approximately 31%
compared with approximately 28% for the first three months of 2004.  The Companys effective rate for both periods
differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to
certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided
because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the
U.S.  The higher tax rate in the first
three months of 2005 versus 2004 is due primarily to an overall increase in
earnings as well as a greater mix of earnings in the U.S.
 
The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax
returns for all years prior to 2001 and proposed certain adjustments.  Certain of these adjustments are being
contested through the IRS Appeals Office.  Substantially all IRS audit
issues for these years have been resolved.  In addition, the Company is
also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.  Management
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
result from tax examinations.  However,
the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty.  Should any issues addressed in the Companys
tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income
tax in the period such resolution occurs.
 
On October 22, 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law.  The AJCA includes a provision for the
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined
in the AJCA.  The Company may elect to
apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either fiscal
year 2005 or 2006.  The Company is
currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision.  An important factor in the Companys
evaluation is additional clarification of key elements of the provision to be
issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. 
Assuming there is sufficient guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department,
the Company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the
repatriation provision no later than the fourth quarter of 2005.  A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for
repatriation.  However, given the
preliminary stage of the Companys evaluation, it is not possible at this time
to determine the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income
tax effects of such repatriation.
 
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2004, the FASB
issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.
EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses
on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for
investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1, which delays the
effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 to investments in
securities that are impaired; however, the disclosure requirements are
effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. Although the Company
will continue to evaluate the application of EITF 03-1, management does not
currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results
of operations or financial position.

In November 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs,
which amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter
4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the
accounting for abnormal amounts of facility expense, freight, handling costs,
and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that under
some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage,
double freight, and rehandling costs may be so
abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.  SFAS 151 requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of
fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005.  Although
the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management
does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys
results of operations or financial position.
 
In December 2004, the
FASB issued FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  FSP
109-2 provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting
period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on their plans for
repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company is currently evaluating
the repatriation provisions of AJCA, which if implemented by the Company would
affect the Companys tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
However, given the preliminary stage of the Companys evaluation, it is not
possible at this time to determine the amount that may be repatriated or the
related potential income tax effects of such repatriation.
 
In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, which amends Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.  The guidance in APB Opinion 29 is based on
the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on
the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in APB Opinion 29,
however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS 153 amends APB
Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary
exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is
effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Although the Company will continue to
evaluate the application of SFAS 153, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or
financial position.
 
In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share-Based
Payment, that addresses the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for
(a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on
the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. 
SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally
would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 123R to
determine which fair-value-based model and transitional provision it will
follow upon adoption. The options for transition methods as prescribed in SFAS
123R include either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective
methods. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be
recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite
service is rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption, while the
modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for stock
options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. Under
the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be restated either as of
the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented.  SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company
beginning in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Although the Company will
continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 123R, management expects adoption
to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations.

As of December 25, 2004,
the Company had $6.448 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments, an increase of $984 million over the same balances at the end
of fiscal 2004. The principal components of this increase were ­cash generated
by operating activities of $775 million and proceeds of $254 million from the
issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by purchases of
property, plant, and equipment of $58 million. The Companys short-term
investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid
investments. Approximately $3.5 billion of this cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments is held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and would
be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend
provisions recently enacted as part of the AJCA, and may decide to repatriate
earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
The Company believes its
existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital
expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other
liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12
months.
 
Capital Expenditures
The Companys
total capital expenditures were $58 million during the first quarter of fiscal
2005, $33 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment
related to the Companys Retail segment and $25 million of which were for
corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and
operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently
anticipates it will utilize approximately $240 million for capital expenditures
during 2005, approximately $125 million of which is expected to be utilized for
expansion of the Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support
normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general
information technology infrastructure.
 
Stock
Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for
the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217
million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283
million of its common stock as of December 25, 2004.
 
Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated
entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained
interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose
the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other
obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
 
32







 
Lease Commitments
As of September 25, 2004,
the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases
of approximately $617 million, $436 million of which related to the lease of
retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Companys existing
operating leases range from 2 to 16 years. Total outstanding commitments on
noncancelable operating leases related to the lease of retail space rose to
$450 million as of December 25, 2004.
 
Purchase Commitments with
Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes
several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys
products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract
manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information
supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a
wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the
Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase
commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature
of the Companys outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and
component purchase commitments has not changed significantly since the end of
its fiscal 2004.  As of December 25,
2004, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and
component purchase commitments of approximately $983 million.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Companys asset
retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property
subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of
September 25, 2004, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows
of approximately $12 million would be required to fulfill these
obligations.  No significant changes to
this estimate have been made in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Other Obligations
As of September 25, 2004,
the Companys other obligations of approximately $24 million are primarily
related to telecommunications services. No significant changes to this estimate
have been made in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Indemnifications
The Company generally
does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software
against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs
and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any
significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against
itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does
not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to
indemnification that would have a material adverse affect on its financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 
Factors
That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
Because
of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys
operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should
not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.
 
General
economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could
adversely affect the demand for the Companys products and the
financial health of its suppliers, distributors,
and resellers.
The Companys operating performance depends significantly on general
economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past several years, demand
for the Companys products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic
conditions. Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appeared to
be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of
the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding.
Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery,
continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to
forecast future demand for the Companys products and related operating
results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand
for the Companys products could be adversely affected, as could the financial
health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
 
33







 
War,
terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt
supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the
Companys operations and performance.
War, terrorism, public
health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad,
have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international
commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a
strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys
suppliers or customers. The Companys major business operations are subject to
interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages,
terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, medical conditions,
and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Companys research and
development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology
systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because
the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related
losses, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other
natural or manmade disaster.
 
Although it is impossible
to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events
could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it
difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers or to receive
components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in
the Companys supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues,
including epidemics, arise the Company could be negatively impacted by the need
for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the
availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be adversely
affected by these events.
 
The market for personal computers
and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and
related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to
effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be
adversely affected.
The personal computer
industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing
practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent
introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry
standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics,
rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price
sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over
the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers
and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The Companys
competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or
maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the
second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Companys
results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may
continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
The personal computer
industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in
software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or
emerging industry standards.  Further, as
the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the
Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler
than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the
Companys existing products.  Several
competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to
target certain of the Companys key market segments, including consumer,
education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and
publishing. Several of the Companys competitors have introduced or announced
plans to introduce digital music products and/or online stores offering digital
music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features,
and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number
of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing,
and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger
installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has
been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has
resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys
markets.
 
The Company is currently
the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market
share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of
computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and
Linux. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are
substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to
the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional
advantages over competing platforms.
 
34







 
The Company is currently
focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and
related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces
increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music
products and distribution services and free peer-to-peer music services. These
competitors include both new entrants with novel market approaches, such as
subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater
technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than those of the
Company, as well as established hardware, software and music content supplier
relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the
Companys operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that
effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell
digital music outside the U.S.  The
Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or
increasing features which could adversely affect the Companys music product
gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins.
 
The Company also faces
increased competition in the U.S. education market. Sales in the U.S. to both
elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university
customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel
remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced
their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which
could negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain
market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to
pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The Companys 1:1
learning solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable
system for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to
a central server.  These 1:1 learning
solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and
could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses,
particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken
certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of
the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements.
Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results
and financial condition.
 
The Company must successfully
manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to remain
competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly
volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer
electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually
introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to
remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products
and upgraded versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new
product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market
acceptance; the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product
transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability of application
software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line
with anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate
quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have
quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the
Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will
have on its sales or results of operations.
 
The
Companys products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can
result in decreased net sales and operating profits.
The Company sells highly
complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and
manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as
those sold by the Company, often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere
with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and
products the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and
software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of
reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy.
 
Because orders for components,
and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance
of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.
The Company records a
write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete
or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues
necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have
been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related
provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product
obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries, no assurance
can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related
charges. In
 
35







 
addition,
such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.
 
The Company must order
components for its products and build inventory in advance of product
shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and subject to rapid
technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast
incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient
inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice,
components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders,
supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such
purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and
manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Companys
operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the
future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its
inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand
patterns.
 
Future
operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a
sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are
in short supply or available only from limited sources.
Although most components
essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple
sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key
components (including without limitation DRAM, and TFT-LCD flat-panel
displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are
at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In
addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom
components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated
whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.
In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial
capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have
matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also
compete for various components with other industries that have experienced
increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are
not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain
microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of
components other than those customized to meet the Companys requirements. If
the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or
existing product, the Companys results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to
produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and
desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., the sole suppliers of the
PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to
provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with
price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the
Companys competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers
of microprocessors used by personal computers using other operating systems.
Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the
Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that
the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it
utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by
other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There
have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Companys
suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity
has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of operations. In
addition, IBM is currently the Companys sole supplier of the PowerPC G5
processor, which is used in the Companys current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac
products. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. is the sole supplier of the G4
processor, which is used in the Companys eMac, Mac mini, and portable
products. IBM has recently experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC
G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various
products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of
fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The inability of IBM to remedy these problems in a timely manner, avoid manufacturing
problems in the future, and to deliver to the Company microprocessors in
sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could further
constrain shipments of products containing the G5 processor and could adversely
affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company is dependent on
manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom
are located outside of the U.S.
Most of the Companys
products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In
addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics
management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations,
they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution.
It is
 
36







 
uncertain
what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the
products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company
to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with
such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement,
the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer
for warranty service in the event of product defects.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty
liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or
otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and
financial condition.
 
Final assembly of
products sold by the Company is currently conducted in the Companys
manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont,
California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples
Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of
the components used in the Companys products and final assembly of
substantially all of the Companys portable products including PowerBooks,
iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan and China.
If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is
disrupted by events such as regional economic, business, environmental,
medical, political, information technology system failures, or military
actions, the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.
 
The Companys future operating
performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers
of the Companys products.
The Company distributes
its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers
and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.
In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain
third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users,
certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores
around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Companys significant
resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected
by recent economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not
covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys
distribution and retail channel partners. The Companys business and financial
results could be adversely affected if the financial condition
of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer channels were to
cease distribution of the Companys products, or if uncertainty regarding
demand for the Companys products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and
marketing of the Companys products.  The
Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance
reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company
employees.  These programs could require
a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of
return or incremental revenue to offset this investment.
 
Over the past several
years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been made by
the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world
and through its retail stores in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. Some of the
Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the Companys direct sales
as conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors
and resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could
discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the
distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease
distribution of the Companys products. The Companys business and financial
results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to
end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of
the Companys products.
 
Further information
regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part
I, Item 1 of the 2004 Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004
under the heading Markets and Distribution.
 
The Company relies on third-party
music content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts
with third parties to offer their music content to customers through the
Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the
rights to offer to its customers this third-party music. Many of the Companys
licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term
in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
Certain parties in the music industry have announced their intent to
consolidate their music distribution operations, which could limit the
availability and increase the fees required to offer music content to customers
through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third-party content providers
currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete
with the Companys music products and services, and could take action to make
it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their music content
in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music
content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand
its
 
37







 
geographic
reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes
Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may
be adversely affected.
 
Third-party content
providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights
management solutions and other security mechanisms.  If the requirements from content providers or
artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license
technology to address such new rights and requirements.  There is no assurance that the Company will
be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the
Companys operating results and financial position.
 
The Companys future performance
is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If
third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the
Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys
products.
The Company believes that
decisions by customers to purchase the Companys personal computers, as opposed
to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party
software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also
believes the availability of third-party application software for the
Companys hardware products depends in part on third-party developers
perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining,
and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the
larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived
strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue
that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the
costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Companys financial
losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the
personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS
licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Companys
prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to
develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys
products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and
upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no
assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X,
the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and
future development by the Company of its own software applications and
solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop,
maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Companys
products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software
applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that
could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or
upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently
marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video
editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and
video productions, professional music production and music post production,
professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, consumer digital video
and digital photo editing and management, digital music management,
desktop-based database management, word processing, and high-quality
presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application
that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation,
spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.
 
In August 1997, the
Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and
technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August
2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh
computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its
Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft
has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft has
not been obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to
August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has
been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to
increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly
with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts interest in
producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the
agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its interests as the
vendor of the Windows operating system and competing digital media
applications, including music distribution service and technology. In June of
2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of Internet
Explorer for the Mac OS, subsequent to the Companys introduction during 2003
of its own web browser, Safari.  Further
discontinuance of products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft
Office and other Microsoft products could have an adverse effect on the Companys
net sales and results of operations.

The Companys business relies on
access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and
the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or
found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys
products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from
third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew
licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the
Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such
licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However,
there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or
available on acceptable terms.
 
Because of technological
changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive
patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible
certain components of the Companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and
litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Part I,
Item 3 of the 2004 Form 10-K.  In the
opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for
damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to
the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to
prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in Part II, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2004 Form 10-K or should several of these
matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the
operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
 
The Companys retail initiative
has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and
commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Through January 2005, the
Company has opened 102 retail stores. The Companys retail initiative has
required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements,
information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered
into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms
ranging from 5 to 16 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company
could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or
close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys
results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high
proportion of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on
store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses
would result should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any
reason.
 
Certain of the Companys
stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that
function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and
brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size,
these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold
improvements than the Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has
opened seven such stores through January 2005. Because of their location and
size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into
substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for
its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging
from 10 to 16 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms
ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of
these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact
on the Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks
and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its
Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks
and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Companys control, that could
adversely affect the Retail segments future results, cause its actual results
to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties
unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail
segment
 
39







 
include, among other
things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail
activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and
operation; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to
sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to
manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience
in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with
unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail
inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
40







 
Investment in new business
strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and may
present risks not originally contemplated.
The Company may decide to
invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the
Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve
significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of managements
attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation
to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and
unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence process.
Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that
such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially
adversely affect the Companys business, operating results or financial
condition.
 
Declines
in the sales of the Companys professional products or increases in sales of
consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Companys gross
margin and operating margin percentages.
Unit sales of the Companys
professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems,
generally have higher gross margins than the Companys consumer products,
including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A
shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower
margin consumer products could adversely affect the Companys future gross
margin and operating margin percentages. The Companys traditional professional
customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and
iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy
the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5
processor used in the Companys Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat
panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks
instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally,
significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher
margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin
percentages.
 
The Company believes that
weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are significant
users of its professional systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys
current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who
are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively
slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in
its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer
manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance.  These factors may result in an adverse impact
to sales of the Companys professional products as well as to gross margin and
operating margin percentages.
 
The Company expects its quarterly
revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.
The Companys profit
margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Companys
direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have
higher associated profitability than its indirect sales.  Additionally, the Companys direct channels
have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware
products, which generally have higher gross margins, than through its indirect
channels.  As a result, the Companys
gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability
may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or
channel mix. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the
third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months,
a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can
produce pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third
month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict
its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products, an internal systems
failure, or failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components
suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on
the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company has higher research
and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage
of revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Companys ability to
compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth
is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of
innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a
result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a
percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on
other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively
on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the
expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing
the Companys brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs
higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors.
If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new
products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be
materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.
 
41







 
The Company is exposed to credit
risk on its accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods when
economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes
its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly
to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial
majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by
collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade
receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale
by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who
manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While
the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit
risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance that
such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding
losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to
improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company
will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial
condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The Companys success depends
largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future
success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its
executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys key employees are located. The Company has
relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting
and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations
requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the Companys future
ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation
costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully
attract and retain key personnel.
 
The Company is subject to risks
associated with the availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed
rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all
areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue
to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy
form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the
Company does not have insurance coverage. 
Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in
some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess
of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results
of operations and financial position.
 
Failure
of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon
which the Company relies could adversely affect the Companys future operating
results.
Information technology system failures and breaches of
data security could disrupt the Companys ability to function in the normal
course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer
orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the
unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has
taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing
sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there
can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the
Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operations.
 
The Companys business is subject
to the risks of international operations.
A large portion of the
Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result,
the Companys operating results and financial condition could be significantly
affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic
and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on
foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are
purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency
exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan,
Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated
operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign
currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact
consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the
Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of
product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
42







 
Margins on sales of the
Companys products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include
components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade
regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Derivative instruments,
such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the
Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.  The use of such hedging
activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
 
Further information
related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A
of the 2004 Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004 under the
subheading Foreign Currency Risk and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of the
2004 Form 10-K for the year ended September 25, 2004 at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Company is subject to risks
associated with environmental regulations.
Production and marketing
of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to
environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of
its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or
recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed
in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various
European Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S. In
the future, these laws could have a material adverse affect on the Companys
results of operations.
 
Changes
in accounting rules could affect the Companys future operating results.
Financial statements are
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,
including the FASB and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who interpret and create appropriate accounting regulations.
A change from current accounting regulations, could
have a significant effect on the Companys results of operations. In December
2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for
share-based payments, SFAS 123R, which will be effective for the Company in its
fourth fiscal quarter of 2005.  Although
the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 123R, management
expects adoption to have a material adverse affect on the Companys results of
operations.
 
Changes in the Companys tax
rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future
effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in
the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in
the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its
income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.
The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income
taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse affect on the Companys net income and
financial condition.
 
The Companys stock price may be
volatile.
The Companys stock has
at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations
between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of
announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market
price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the
operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of
positive general economic and political conditions and investors concerns
regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of
financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the
Companys stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Companys stock
price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share.
 
For
a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Companys future results
and financial condition, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis -
Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition and Item 1, Business
in the Companys 2004 Form 10-K.
 
43







 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk
The Companys
market risk profile has not changed significantly from that described in the
2004 Form 10-K.
 
Interest Rate and Foreign
Currency Risk Management
The Company regularly
reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate
swap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction
with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures.
However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management
activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact
resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In
addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses
related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic
exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results
and financial position.
 
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company is
exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading
industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this
regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the
Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as
costs associated with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys short-term
investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet
liquidity requirements, and optimize return in light of current credit and
interest rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance by utilizing
external money managers to manage a small portion of the aggregate investment
portfolio. The external managers adhere to the Companys investment policies
and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements
internal research used to make credit decisions in the investment process.
 
The Companys exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys
investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments in highly
liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy
is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial
maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly
liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as
short-term investments. As of December 25, 2004, approximately $449
million of the Companys short-term investments had underlying maturities
ranging from 1 to 5 years.  The remainder
all had underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. The Company may sell its
investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in
anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company
recognized no material net gains or losses during the first quarter of 2005 or
2004 related to such sales.
 
From time to time, the
Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial
institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys
exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  The Company did not enter into any interest
rate derivatives during the first quarter of 2005 or 2004.
 
Foreign Currency Risk
In general, the Company
is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as
expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to
adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there
has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The Company may enter
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash
flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign
exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost
of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate
hedging instruments.
 
44







 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation
of the Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (Exchange Act)) were effective as of
December 25, 2004 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
 
There were no significant changes in the Companys internal control
over financial reporting identified in managements evaluation during the first
quarter of fiscal 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
 
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
discussed below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings
and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have
not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not
have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims
that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the
first quarter of 2005, which did not individually or in the aggregate have a
material impact on the Companys results of operations.
 
Antor Media Corporation v. Apple
Computer, Inc., et al.
Plaintiff Antor Media filed this action on September 5, 2003 in
the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Texas alleging
infringement by the Company and other defendants of U.S. patent 5,754,961
relating to a Method and Apparatus for Transmitting Information Recorded on
Information Storage Means from a Central Server to Subscribers via a High Data
Rate Digital Telecommunications Network. The complaint sought unspecified
damages and other relief. The Company answered the complaint, denied all
material allegations, asserted numerous affirmative defenses, and asserted
counterclaims requesting declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
invalidity. Trial was set for March 2005.

Apple Corps Ltd. v. Apple Computer, Inc.;
Apple Computer, Inc. v. Apple Corps Ltd.
Plaintiff Apple Corps filed this action on July 4, 2003 in the
High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, in London alleging that the Company
has breached a 1991 agreement that resolved earlier trademark litigation
between the parties regarding use of Apple marks. Plaintiff seeks an
injunction, unspecified damages and other relief. The Company filed a motion on
October 13, 2003, challenging jurisdiction in the U.K. The Court denied
this motion on April 7, 2004. The Company filed an appeal of the Courts
decision but subsequently withdrew the appeal. 
In November 2004, Apple Corps served the Company with an Amended Bill of
Particulars and on December 23, 2004 the Company filed a Defence.
 
On October 8, 2003, the Company filed a lawsuit against Apple
Corps in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California requesting a declaratory judgment that the Company has not breached
the 1991 agreement. Apple Corps challenged jurisdiction in the California case
but the Court denied that challenge on March 25, 2004. Apple Corps
subsequently prevailed on a motion to stay the California case during the
pendency of the U.K. action. The Company has dismissed the California lawsuit
without prejudice.
 
Cagney v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this purported class action on January 9, 2004 in

competition) and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The Company was
served on January 21, 2004, and filed an answer on February 20, 2004,
denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The
Company is investigating these allegations. The
 
45







 
Company filed a motion to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel, which the
Court denied. The Company filed a petition for a writ of mandate with respect
to this ruling and the Court of Appeal has issued an order to show cause as to
why the writ should not issue. Plaintiffs lead counsel subsequently withdrew.
The hearing on the show cause order took place on January 26, 2005 and the Court
has not yet issued its ruling. The Company has obtained an opinion on the tax
issue from the State Board of Equalization.
 
Compression Labs, Inc. v. Apple
Computer, Inc., et al.; Apple v. Compression Labs, Inc., et al.
Plaintiff Compression Labs, Inc. filed this patent infringement
action on April 22, 2004 against the Company and twenty-seven other
defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of

Plaintiff alleges that the Company infringes the patent by complying with the
JPEG standard as defined by CCITT Recommendation T.81 entitled Information
TechnologyDigital Compression and Coding of Continuous Tone Still
ImagesRequirements and Guidelines. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and
other relief. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative,
to transfer the case to Delaware. The motion was heard on January 31, 2005 and the
Court has not yet issued its ruling. The case is in discovery and trial is
expected to be held in October 2005 at the earliest.
 
On July 2, 2004, the Company and several other defendants in the
Texas action filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court in Delaware
against Compression Labs, Inc. and two other companies, requesting declaratory
judgment of noninfringement, invalidity, implied license and unenforceability
with respect to the 672 patent. 
Defendants in the Delaware action have filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint, but the motion is not yet set for hearing.  Discovery is stayed in the Delaware
case.  Additional actions regarding this
patent have been filed in other jurisdictions. A petition has been filed with
the Panel on Multi-District Litigation (MDL), seeking coordination and
transfer of all of these cases to one court for pre-trial proceedings.  A hearing on the MDL petition took place on
January 27, 2005 and the Court has not yet issued its ruling.

2003, the Company filed a motion to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel in his role
as counsel to the purported class and to the general public. The Court granted
the motion, but allowed Plaintiff to retain substitute counsel. Plaintiff did
engage new counsel for the general public, but not for the class. The Company
 
46







 
moved to disqualify Plaintiffs
new counsel and to have the Court dismiss the general public claims for
equitable relief. The Court declined to disqualify Plaintiffs new counsel or
to dismiss the equitable claims, but did confirm that the class action claims
are dismissed. The case is stayed pending an appeal.
