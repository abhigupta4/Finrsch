APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
 
Apple Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs,
manufactures and markets personal computers and related software, peripherals
and personal computing and communicating solutions. The Companys products
include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X
operating system, the iPod digital music player, and a portfolio of software
products and peripherals for education, creative, consumer and business
customers. The Company sells its products through its online stores, direct
sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail stores.
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Interim
information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Companys management,
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of
interim periods presented have been included. 
The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results to be expected for the entire year.
 
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes should be read in conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended
September 27, 2003, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended September 27, 2003 (the 2003 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise
stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Companys
fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those
fiscal years.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The Company applies the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation,
as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure as if the fair value-based method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow
APB Opinion No. 25 because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the
exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
As required under SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based
compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock
options granted and employee stock purchase plan share purchases have been
estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using
a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures,
the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma
net income over the options vesting period and the shares plan period.
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of freely traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life
of options and the Companys expected stock price volatility. Because the
Companys employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have
characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not
provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock
options and employee stock purchase plan shares.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been
issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock is
reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
method.
 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except net income and per share
amounts):

Options to purchase approximately 14.4
million shares of common stock that were outstanding at December 27, 2003,
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the
first quarter of 2004 because the
 
6







 
options exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the Companys common stock during this period, and
therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. At December 28, 2002,
the Company had options to purchase approximately 109.4 million shares of its
common stock outstanding, all of which were excluded from the computation of
diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2003 because the effect would
have been antidilutive.

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of investments
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt
securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of
which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized losses of
$2 million and $1 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to
investments with stated maturities greater than 1 year, as of December 27,
2003 and September 27, 2003, respectively. The Company occasionally sells
short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such
sales, the Company recognized no gains during the first quarter of 2004 and
recognized gains of $9 million during the first quarter of 2003. These net
gains were included in interest and other income, net.
 
As of December 27, 2003, and
September 27, 2003, $694 million and $629 million, respectively, of the
Companys investment portfolio that was classified as short-term investments
had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. 
The remainder of the Companys short-term investments had underlying
maturities between 3 and 12 months.
 
Non-Current
Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains
The Company has held significant investments
in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and
EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in
the condensed consolidated balance sheets as long term assets within other
assets and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported
in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All
realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in interest
and other income.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold all of its remaining
non-current investments in public companies, consisting of 986,164 shares of
Akamai for net proceeds of approximately $5 million, and a gain before taxes of
$4 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares
of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount
that approximated the Companys carrying value of the shares.

Debt
The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of
$300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were
originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes,
along with approximately $1.5 million of related unamortized deferred gains on
closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have
been classified as current debt as of December 27, 2003.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales. From time to
time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  As of the end of the first quarter of 2004, the general nature of
the Companys risk management activities and the general nature and mix of the
Companys derivative financial instruments have not changed materially from the
end of fiscal 2003.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts
with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions and certain probable but not firmly committed transactions.
Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing
material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not
hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality,
prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or limited
availability of appropriate hedging instruments.
 
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with
financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate
interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its
fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a
portion of the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S.
interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that
are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management
program.  The Company does not hold or
transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.
 
Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments
The Company accounts for all derivatives at fair value. Derivatives
that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If the
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair
value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As
of December 27, 2003, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with
cash flow hedges of approximately $24 million net of taxes, substantially all
of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the third
quarter of fiscal 2004.

Note 4  Restructuring Actions
 
2003 Restructuring Actions
The Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8
million during the year ended September 27, 2003, including approximately
$7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred
compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for
lease cancellations.
 
During the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount
originally accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due
to the sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an
approximately $500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to
higher than expected severance costs
 
9







 
related to the closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing
operations. These adjustments had a net neutral effect on reported operating
expense.
 
During the second quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved
and initiated restructuring actions that resulted in recognition of a total
restructuring charge of $2.8 million, including $2.4 million in severance costs
and $400,000 for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility.
Actions taken in the second quarter were for the most part supplemental to
actions initiated in the prior two quarters and focused on further headcount
reductions in various sales and marketing functions in the Companys Americas
and Europe operating segments and further reductions associated with
PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas operating segment, including an
accrual for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. The
second quarter actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 93
positions worldwide, all but one of which were eliminated by the end of the
first quarter of 2004.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and
initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted
in the termination of manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in
Singapore, further reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in
PowerSchool product strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and
termination of various sales and marketing activities in the United States and
Europe. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of 260
positions worldwide.
 
Closure of the Companys Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in
severance costs of $1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write off
manufacturing related fixed assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter
of 2003. PowerSchool related costs included severance of approximately $550,000
and recognition of $5 million of previously deferred stock compensation that
arose when PowerSchool was acquired by the Company in 2001 related to certain
PowerSchool employee stockholders who were terminated in the first quarter of
2003. Termination of sales and marketing activities and employees, principally
in the United States and Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million
and accrual of costs associated with operating leases on closed facilities of
$6.7 million. The total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized
during the first quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of
unused restructuring accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.
 
Of the $26.8 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of the first
quarter of 2004, except for approximately $200,000 of severance costs and
approximately $4.1 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned
facilities. The Company currently anticipates that all of the remaining accrual
for severance costs of approximately $200,000 will be spent in fiscal 2004 and
the remaining accrual for operating lease costs will be paid over the remaining
lease terms.

Note 5  Comprehensive Income
 
Comprehensive income consists of two
components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive
income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally
accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders
equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive
income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
 
10







 
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains
and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Note
6  Employee Benefit Plans
 
2003 Employee Stock Option Plan
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the
shareholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to
change the name of the plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003
Plan), to provide for broad-based grants to all employees in addition to
executive officers and other key employees and to prohibit future repricings
of employee stock options, including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange
programs, without shareholder approval. Based on the terms of individual option
grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years,
based on continued employment, with either annual or quarterly vesting. The
2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock
options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase
rights.
 
11







 
1997 Employee Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997
Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for
grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based
on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan
generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally become
exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, with
either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of
amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the
Company terminated the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancelled all
remaining unissued shares, following the completion of an employee stock option
exchange program in October 2003.
 
Employee
Stock Option Exchange Program
On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee
stock option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible
employees, other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors,
had an opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or
above $25.00 per share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options
issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the
Companys common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which will be at
least six months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled.  On April 17, 2003, in accordance with
the Exchange Program, the Company cancelled options to purchase 16,569,193
shares of its common stock. On October 22, 2003, new stock options
totaling 6,697,368 shares were issued to employees at an exercise price of
$22.76 per share, which is equivalent to the closing price of the Companys
stock on that date. No financial or accounting impact to the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flow was associated with this
transaction.
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee
directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest
in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of
the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully
vested at grant.
 
Rule
10b5-1 Trading Plans
Certain of the Companys executive officers, including Mr. Timothy D.
Cook and Mr. Fred D. Anderson, have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule
10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan
is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or
formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or
sales of Apple stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options
and shares acquired pursuant to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan
(the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase
common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of
the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six month offering
periods. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an
employees compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. As of
December 27, 2003, approximately 3 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
Beginning with the six month offering period that started on
June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is limited to
a total of 1 million shares per offering period. During the first quarter of
2004 and 2003, respectively, approximately 1.0 million and 1.1 million shares
were issued under the Purchase Plan.

Note
7  Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income
(loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair value method of accounting
for stock compensation had been used for its employee stock option grants and
employee stock purchase plan purchases. These pro forma effects have been
estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
 
For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No.
123, the option awards issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as
part of the Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for
using modification accounting.  In
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards issued is the date
of acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees.

The assumptions used for the three month periods ended

Note
8  Commitments and Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail
space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not
currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major
facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal
options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for
terms of 5 to 15 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 27, 2003, the Companys total future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases were $600 million, of which $354 million
related to leases for retail space.  As
of December 27, 2003, total future minimum lease payments related to
leases for retail space increased to $386 million.
 
Accrued Warranty and Indemnifications
The Company offers a basic limited parts and
labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple
service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides
currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited
product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors
considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations
include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty
protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and
projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are
outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy
of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future expectations.
 
The following table reconciles changes in the
Companys accrued warranties and related costs for the three month periods
ended December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating
system and application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements
entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from
such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential
 
14







 
liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to
indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations. Therefore, the Company did not
record a liability for infringement costs as of either December 27, 2003
or September 27, 2003.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer.
These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf
of persons who purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege
violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are
without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion
to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on
September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the
Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave
to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard
the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims
with prejudice on August 12, 2003. 
Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal
proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does
not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and
claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However,
the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected.
 
Production and marketing of products in certain
states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other
regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers
the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place
responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company.
Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in
which the Company operates including various European Union member countries,
Japan and California.  Although the
Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on
the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance
that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect
on the Companys results of operations and financial position.
 
Note
9 - Segment Information and Geographic Data
 
The Company manages its business primarily on
a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments are comprised
of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both
North and South America, except for the activities of the Companys Retail
segment. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, except for the
activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Retail segment currently
operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and Japan. Other
operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia
except for Japan, and the Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable
geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products
and similar services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are
the same as those described in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K in Note 1, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies, except as described below for the Retail
segment.
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its
operating segments based on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also
evaluated based on operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Operating income for each
segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income
include various corporate expenses, manufacturing costs not included in standard
costs, income taxes, and various nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses
include research and development, corporate marketing expenses, and other
separately managed general and administrative expenses including certain
corporate expenses associated with support of the Retail segment. The Company
does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets
 
15







 
include cash, short-term and long-term
investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure,
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the
Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $28
million and $6 million during the first quarters of 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
 
Operating income for all segments, except
Retail, includes cost of sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses
and related adjustments not included in segment cost of sales, including
variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above
standard cost for product supplied to the Retail segment, are included in
corporate expenses.
 
To assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several
significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting
that are not included in results of the Companys other segments. First, cost
of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Companys standard
cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Companys major channel
partners in the United States. For the first quarter of 2004 and 2003, this
resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by
the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of
approximately $52 million and $23 million, respectively.
 
Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from
sales of the Companys extended warranty, support and service contracts and
also recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount at which such
contracts are normally sold to the Companys major channel partners in the
United States. This treatment is consistent with how the Companys major
resellers account for the sales and cost of the Companys extended warranty and
support contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred
the costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these
amounts is recognized in other operating segments net sales and cost of sales.
For the first quarter of 2004, this resulted in the recognition of net sales
and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in other
operating segments, of $12 million and $8 million, respectively. For the first
quarter of 2003, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail
segment for sales of extended warranty, support and service contracts were $6
million and $4 million, respectively.
 
Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high
profile retail stores is allocated from the Retail segment to corporate
marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of
these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements,
function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and
marketing events, and brand awareness. 
Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs
incurred by one of the Companys more typical retail locations. Stores were
open in four such high profile locations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and
Tokyo, Japan as of December 27, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate
marketing resulting from the operations of these stores were $2.2 million and
$1.1 million in the first quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively.

10  Related Party Transactions and Certain Other Transactions
 
In March 2002, the Company entered into a Reimbursement Agreement
with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven P. Jobs, for the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs in the operation of his private plane when used
for Apple business.  The Reimbursement Agreement
became effective for expenses incurred by Mr. Jobs for Apple business purposes
since he took delivery of the plane in May 2001. The Company recognized a total
of $282,000 and $84,000 in expenses pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement
during the first quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively. All expenses
recognized pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement have been included in
selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.
 
In connection with a relocation assistance package, the Company in May
2000 loaned Mr. Ronald B. Johnson, Senior Vice President, Retail, $1.5
million for the purchase of his principal residence. The loan is secured by a
deed of trust and is due and payable in May 2004. Under the terms of the
loan, Mr. Johnson agreed that should he exercise any of his stock options
prior to the due date of the loan, he would pay the Company an amount equal to
the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the total net gain realized
from the exercise of the options; or (2) $375,000 multiplied by the number
of years between the exercise date and the date of the loan. Mr. Johnson repaid
$750,000 of this loan in fiscal 2003. 
The current outstanding balance of $750,000 is due and payable in May
2004.
 
Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased
MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MicroWarehouse) in January 2000. Until
September 7, 2003, he also served as its Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a reseller of computer hardware, software
and peripheral products, including products made by the Company. On
September 8, 2003, CDW Corporation (CDW), acquired selected North American
assets of MicroWarehouse. MicroWarehouse subsequently filed for Chapter 11
 
17







 
bankruptcy protection in the United States. MicroWarehouse accounted
for 0.4% and 3.2% of the Companys net sales in the first quarter of 2004 and
2003, respectively. Trade receivables from MicroWarehouse were $8.9 million and
$9.9 million as of December 27, 2003 and September 27, 2003,
respectively. The Company has provided what it believes to be an adequate
allowance on the outstanding receivable based on the Companys secured interest
position in selected MicroWarehouse assets and the expected payments to
unsecured creditors. Sales to MicroWarehouse and related trade receivables were
generally subject to the same terms and conditions as those with the Companys
other resellers. In addition, the Company has purchased miscellaneous equipment
and supplies from MicroWarehouse. Total purchases amounted to approximately
$834,000 in the first quarter of 2003. No purchases were made in the first
quarter of 2004.

Executive Overview
Apple designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related
software and services, peripherals and personal computing and communicating
solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores,
direct sales force, third-party wholesalers and resellers, and its own retail
stores. The Companys products and services include the Macintosh line of
desktop and notebook computers, the Mac OS X operating system, the iPod digital
music player, the iTunes Music Store and digital music management software, and
a portfolio of other software products, peripherals and services for education,
creative, consumer and business customers. 
A further description of the Companys products may be found below and
in Part I, Item 1 of the 2003 Form 10-K under the heading Business.
 
The Company competes in several highly competitive markets including
the personal computer industry with its Macintosh line of computers and related
software, the consumer electronics industry with products such as the iPod, and
digital music distribution through its iTunes Music Store. The Company
continually faces both aggressive pricing practices as well as the emergence of
new competitors in these markets.  In an
effort to remain competitive in these markets, the Company intends to continue
focusing on creating innovative products and services aligned with its digital
hub strategy, whereby the Macintosh functions as the digital hub for digital
devices including the iPod, personal digital assistants, cellular phones,
digital video and still cameras and other electronic devices.  The Company is also concentrating on
expanding and improving its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail
stores, both domestically and internationally, in high traffic quality shopping
venues; staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees; entering
into strategic alliances with other companies to brand and sell the Companys
products and services; increasing the accessibility of iPods through various
resellers that do not currently sell Macintosh systems; and increasing the
reach of its online stores.
 
Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
requires the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates
that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Companys 2003 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of
 
19







 
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies are
those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts,
inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory purchase commitments,
valuation of long-lived assets including acquired intangibles, warranty costs,
and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition
and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain. Additional information about these
critical accounting policies may by found in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K in
Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, under the heading Critical Accounting Policies.

Net sales during the first quarter of 2004 increased 36% or $534
million from the same quarter in 2003. 
Several factors have contributed to this increase including:
 
                  Net sales of
peripherals and other hardware rose $281 million or 129% during the first
quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003. This increase is due
primarily to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod net sales of $175
million or 216%.  Strong iPod sales were
experienced in all of the Companys operating segments during the first quarter
of 2004 due to increased demand for this product during the holiday season. In
addition, iPod sales during the current year were favorably affected by several
factors including the introduction of Macintosh and Windows compatible models
with increased capacity to either 10GB, 20GB, or 40GB; the Companys
introduction of a new version of the iTunes Music Store in the U.S. for both
Macintosh and Windows users in October 2003; and because the Company has
expanded its iPod distribution network. Net sales of peripherals and other
hardware during the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter in 2003
also reflect an increase of $106 million or 77% in net sales of displays and
other computer accessories, including AirPort cards and base stations; iSight
digital video cameras; third party digital cameras and printers; and a number
of iPod related accessories.  The
majority of this increase in net sales of peripherals and other hardware was
experienced by the Companys Americas, Europe, and Retail segments.
 
                  Total Macintosh
unit sales increased by 12% and net sales increased by 15% or $170 million over
the same quarter of the prior year. 
Unit sales of the Companys professional desktop and portable systems
have been relatively strong in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same
quarter in 2003. On a year-over-year basis, Power Macintosh and PowerBook unit
sales increased 30% and 93%, respectively. The increase in Power Macintosh
sales is due to the Power Mac G5, which did not begin shipping until the end of
fiscal 2003 and did not realize a full quarter of sales until the first quarter
of 2004. In addition, iBook unit sales increased 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Unit sales of portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook,
represented a record high 48% of all Macintosh systems sold during the quarter
and increased by 38% from the same quarter in the prior year, which reflects an
overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. The Companys average
net sales per Macintosh unit sold increased 4% to $1,531 in the first quarter
of 2004 from $1,479 in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of various changes
in overall unit mix towards relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh and
PowerBook systems and an increase in direct sales primarily from the Companys
retail and online stores, somewhat offset by lower year-over-year pricing for
the first quarter of 2004 on comparable Macintosh systems for most of the
Companys Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure.
 
                  The Retail
segments net sales grew to $273 million during the first quarter of 2004 from
$148 million during the same period in 2003, an 84% increase. This increase was
largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 51 at the end of the
first quarter of 2003 to 73 at the end of the first quarter of 2004, as well as
an increase in average revenue per store. While the Companys customers in
areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the
Retail segment stores rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in
the United States, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the
Retail segments net sales is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See
additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment
Operating Performance.
 
                  Net sales of
software rose $61 million or 69% during the first quarter of 2004 compared to
the same quarter in 2003. This increase reflects higher net sales of
Apple-branded software, including in particular, Mac OS X version 10.3
Panther, which was released in October 2003 and accounted for
approximately $45 million of the total $61 million year-over-year increase in
software net sales.
 
                  The Company
experienced year-over-year improvement in its U.S. education channel during the
first quarter of 2004 with net sales and unit sales increasing by 20% and 8%,
respectively, from the same quarter in 2003. 
Despite this improvement, the Company believes that there is continued
uncertainty in this channel from increased competition in the education market
and reduced spending by U.S. educational institutions due to federal and state
funding concerns and tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy.
Although the Company has taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to
address this weakness, it remains difficult to anticipate when and if this
trend will reverse.
 
23







 
                  Service and
other net sales rose $22 million or 33% during the first quarter of 2004
compared to the same quarter in 2003. This increase is the result of
significant year-over-year increases in quarterly net sales associated with
AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended maintenance and support services, as
well as increases in net sales associated with Internet services. Increased net
sales associated with APP are primarily the result of higher attach rates on
APP over the last several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet
services are due primarily to the introduction of the iTunes Music Store,
introduced for the Macintosh in April of 2003 and updated in
October 2003 for both Windows and Macintosh users, and increased net sales
from the Companys .Mac Internet service.
 
Offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Companys net
sales during the first quarter of 2004 were negatively impacted by the
following:
 
                  Net sales and
unit sales of iMac systems were down 29% and 24%, respectively during the first
quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003. Sales of flat panel iMac
systems, which have a suggested retail price starting at $1,299, have been
negatively affected by a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and
lower priced desktop models with price points below $1,000. Also, the current
flat panel iMac and eMac form factors are approximately 2 years old, which
contributed to the decline in net sales.
 
Segment Operating
Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan, except for the activities of the Companys Retail
segment.  The Retail segment currently
operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States and opened its first
international store in Tokyo, Japan in the first quarter of 2004. Each reportable
geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products
and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating
segments may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and
Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net
sales in the Americas segment during the first quarter of 2004 increased $186
million or 25% compared to the same quarter in 2003, while unit sales remained
flat year-over year. Approximately half of this increase in net sales was
attributable to higher iPod sales, which as noted above was largely due to the
recent availability of the iPod and iTunes Music Store for both the Macintosh
and Windows platforms. The net sales of the Americas segment also reflect
higher sales of other peripherals, software, and services during the first
quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 due primarily to higher
sales of Mac OS X Panther, Internet services, and APP extended warranty
contracts. The results of this segment reflect strong sales of Power Macintosh
and PowerBook products, somewhat offset by weakness in sales of the Companys
consumer systems.  As noted above, the
Company experienced a year-over-year improvement in its U.S. education channel
net sales driven primarily by an increase in higher education net sales.
Despite these improvements, there is continued uncertainty in this channel from
increased competition in the education market and reduced spending by U.S. educational
institutions due to federal and state funding concerns and tax revenue
shortfalls resulting from the weak economy.
 
Europe
Net
sales in Europe increased $168 million or 48% during the first quarter of 2004
as compared to the same quarter in 2003.  Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe increased 19% on a
year-over-year basis.  Other than
weakened demand for the iMac, Europe experienced strong net sales across all
product lines in the first quarter of 2004. Demand in Europe in the current
quarter was particularly strong for the Companys professional Macintosh
systems, iPods, peripherals and software.
 
Japan
Japans
net sales increased 13% during the first quarter of 2004 from the same quarter
in 2003, while Macintosh unit sales were up 8%. Demand in Japan in the current
quarter was particularly strong for the Companys Power Macintosh product,
iPods, peripherals and software. However, Japan did experience a decrease in
net sales of both portable systems and iMacs during the first quarter of 2004
as compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Although Japans net sales
and Macintosh unit sales have recovered slightly in 2004, the segments results
remain significantly below its historic levels due primarily to current
economic conditions that remain negative in Japan.
 
24







 
Retail
The Company opened eight new retail stores, including its first
international store in the Ginza in Tokyo, Japan, during the first quarter of
2004. The Company had 73 retail stores open at the end of the first quarter of
2004 as compared to 51 open stores at the end of the first quarter of
2003.  During the first quarter of 2004,
the Retail segments net sales grew to $273 million, including $4 million from
its Ginza store which opened on November 30, 2003, from $148 million in
2003, an 84% increase.  With an average
of 69 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per store
increased to $4 million, up from $3.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The
Retail segment has contributed strongly to the increase in net sales of
computer peripherals and software experienced by the Company during 2004.
During the first quarter of 2004, approximately 53% of the Retail segments net
sales came from the sale of iPods, other Apple-branded and third-party
peripherals, software and services. This compares to 42% for the Retail segment
during the first quarter of 2003 and 37% for the Company as a whole during the
first quarter of 2004.
 
In accordance with the Companys operating segment reporting, as
further discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information and
Geographic Data, the Retail segment reported a profit of $9 million during the
first quarter of 2004 compared to a loss of $1 million during the same period
in 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segments
year-over-year increase in average quarterly revenue per store and the impact
of the opening of 22 new stores.
 
Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to
require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure,
operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital
expenditures associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled
$290 million through the end of fiscal 2003, and totaled $28 million during the
first quarter of 2004. As of December 27, 2003, the Retail segment had
approximately 1,550 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments
associated with retail store space and related facilities of $386 million. The
Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail
segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the
Companys results of operations and financial condition. Investment in a new
business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in
light of the significant investment involved, the current economic climate, and
the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail segments operating
expenses.

Gross
margin for the first quarter of 2004 was 26.7% compared to 27.6% for the same
quarter in 2003. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due
to pricing actions on certain Power Mac G5 models that were transitioned during
the quarter and purchase order cancellation costs associated with these product
transitions. In addition, the Company experienced higher warranty costs on
certain portable Macintosh products contributing to the reduction in gross
margin.

Research and
Development (R&D)
Expenditures
for R&D decreased 2% or $2 million to $119 million in the first quarter of
2004 compared to $121 million in the same quarter of 2003. Although R&D
headcount increased slightly over the same period in the prior year, the
decrease in total R&D expense is merely a function of the timing of new
product introductions and the stage in the development cycle of new projects,
because costs are typically lower in the beginning of the product development
cycle and increase as product release is approached. R&D as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 6% in the first quarter of 2004 as compared to 8% in the
same quarter of the prior year, which is primarily due to the significant
increase in total net sales for the Company of 36%, as well as the slight
decrease in R&D expense. The Company continues to believe that focused
investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position
in the marketplace and expects to continue to invest heavily in R&D for
further innovation to remain competitive.
 
Selling, General,
and Administrative Expense (SG&A)
SG&A
increased 15% or $44 million to $343 million in the first quarter of 2004
compared to $299 million in the same quarter of 2003. This increase is due
primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both
domestic and international markets resulting in an increase of approximately
$17 million, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and
advertising of approximately $9 million, and an increase of approximately $6
million in restricted stock amortization. 
The remaining increase of $12 million was primarily attributable to
higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net
sales and employee salary merit increases.
 
Restructuring Costs
During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a net restructuring charge of
$23 million related primarily to the termination of manufacturing operations at
the Company-owned facility in Singapore, reductions in headcount resulting from
the shift in PowerSchool product strategy, and termination of various sales and
marketing activities in the United States and Europe.
 
Other Income and

Gain on Sales of Non-current
Investments
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold its remaining
non-current investments in public companies consisting of 986,164 shares of
Akamai Technologies for net proceeds of approximately $5 million and a gain
before
 
26







 
taxes of $4 million. As of December 27, 2003, the Company does not
have any non-current public company investments reflected in its condensed
consolidated balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company sold
2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately $13.7
million, an amount that approximated the Companys carrying value of the shares
sold.
 
Interest and Other Income, Net
Total interest and other income, net decreased $20 million or 69% to
$9 million during the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same quarter
in 2003. This decrease is attributable primarily to declining investment yields
on the Companys cash and short-term investments resulting from lower market
interest and a shortening of the average maturity of the Companys investment
portfolio. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 1.27% in the first
quarter of 2004 compared to the 2.55% rate earned during the same period in
2003. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their
stated maturities. The sale of short-term investments during the first quarter
of 2003 was intended to shorten the average maturity of the Companys
investment portfolio based on managements belief that interest rates were at
or near their bottom. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net
gains of $9 million during the first quarter of 2003. No gains on early sales
of short-term investments were recognized during the first quarter of 2004.
 
Interest expense consists primarily of interest on the Companys
$300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes partially offset
by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from
the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes. The
unsecured notes, which mature in February of 2004, were sold at 99.925% of
par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting
from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million, $1.5 million of
which remained unamortized as of December 27, 2003, is being amortized
over the remaining life of the unsecured notes. The Company currently expects
to repay this debt upon its maturity.
 
Provision for Income
Taxes
The
Companys effective tax rate for the first three months of 2004 and 2003 was
approximately 28%. The Companys effective rate differs from the statutory
federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign
earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and due to research and
development credits.
 
On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed
its audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 1998
through 2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are
being contested through the IRS Appeals Office.  Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have
been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for
any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of
tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in
the Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with
managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its
provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.
 
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and
applied immediately to any variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is
obtained after that date.  For variable interest entities created or
acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be
applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after
December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provision of FIN 46 related to
variable interests created after January 31, 2003 did not have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  The Company continues to evaluate the
provisions of FIN 46, and does not believe that the adoption of the remaining
provisions will have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position.
 
In May 2003, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached
consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.  EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on
how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The
provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to revenue transactions entered into
in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.  Additionally, in August 2003, the EITF reached consensus on
EITF Issue No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement
Containing More-than-Incidental Software. 
EITF Issue No. 03-5 provides guidance on determining
 
27







 
whether non-software deliverables are included within the scope of SOP
97-2, and accordingly, whether multiple element arrangements are to be
accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21 or SOP 97-2. The
application of EITF Issue Nos. 00-21 and 03-5 did not have a significant impact
on the Companys results of operations or financial position.
 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee
stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow
APB Opinion No. 25 because, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form
10-Q at Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the
exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
The FASB
decided on April 22, 2003 to require all companies to expense the value of
employee stock options. Companies will be required to measure the cost of
employee stock options according to their fair value. The FASB has indicated
that it plans to issue in the first quarter of calendar year 2004 an exposure
draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter. Prior to issuance of
this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated it will be addressing several
significant technical issues. Among other things, the FASB must determine the
extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to
recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance
outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation
expense recognized. Also, a method to determine the fair value of employee
stock options must be established. Current accounting standards require use of
an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes formula, to determine fair
value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the
model. This valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be
subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair
value of employee stock options under the new standard.
 
At the Companys annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003,
shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Companys Board of
Directors (the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future
employee stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management
appreciate and take seriously the views expressed by the Companys
shareholders. As discussed in the Companys Form 10-Q for the period ended
March 29, 2003, the Company decided not to expense the value of employee
stock options until the FASB finalizes its new accounting standard on the
matter. The Company based this decision on the FASBs announced intention to
soon require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options and
the FASBs near-term review of technical issues that will play a significant
role in determining the fair value of and accounting for employee stock
options. The Company monitors progress at the FASB and other developments with
respect to the general issue of employee stock compensation. In the future,
should the Company expense the value of employee stock options, either out of
choice or due to new requirements issued by the FASB, the Company may have to
recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could
have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations.

As of December 27, 2003, the Company had $4.791 billion in
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of
$225 million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 2003.
Approximately $2.7 billion of this cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
are held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to U.S.
income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The principal components of this
increase were  cash generated by
operating activities of $219 million, and proceeds of $32 million from the
issuance of common stock, partially offset by capital expenditures of $44
million.
 
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital
needs, capital expenditures, debt obligations, stock repurchase activity,
outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its
existing operations over the next 12 months.
 
Debt
The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of
$300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that were
originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes,
along with approximately $1.5 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed
interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been
classified as current debt as of December 27, 2003. The Company currently
anticipates utilizing its existing cash balances to settle these notes when
due.
 
Capital Expenditures
The Companys total capital expenditures were $44 million during the
first quarter of fiscal 2004, $28 million of which were for retail store
facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $16
million of which were for corporate infrastructure, including information
systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The
Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $160 million for
capital expenditures during 2004, approximately $85 million of which is
expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Companys Retail segment
and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital
assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In
July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for the
Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company had repurchased a total of 6.55 million shares at a cost of $217
million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million
of its common stock as of December 27, 2003.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The
Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities
whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests,
derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company
to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation
under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company.
 
Lease Commitments
As of September 27, 2003, the Company had total outstanding
commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $600 million,
$354 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities.
Remaining terms on the Companys existing operating leases range from 1 to 12
years. Total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases related
to the lease of retail space rose to $386 million as of December 27, 2003.
 
Purchase Commitments
with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture
sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and
test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and
build
 
29







 
product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which
typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains
individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders
based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically
cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Companys outstanding
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has not
changed significantly since the end of its fiscal 2003.
 
Indemnifications
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating
system and application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements
entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential
liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification
that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations.
 
Factors That May Affect Future
Results and Financial Condition
 
Because of the following factors, as well as other
factors affecting the Companys operating results and financial condition, past
financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of
future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate
results or trends in future periods.
 
General economic
conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely
affect the demand for the Companys products and the financial
health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
The
Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic
conditions. For much of the past several years, demand for the Companys
products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions.
Additionally, some of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying
technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker
economy on their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic
conditions makes it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should
global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to
deteriorate, demand for the Companys products could continue to be adversely
affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
 
War, terrorism or
public health issues could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products which
could negatively affect the Companys operations and performance.
War, terrorism or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad,
have caused and could continue to cause damage or disruption to international
commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a
strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Companys
suppliers or customers.  Although it is
impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such
events could result in a decrease in demand for the Companys products, make it
difficult or impossible to deliver products to its customers or to receive
components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in
the Companys supply chain. The Companys operating results and financial
condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected
by these events.
 
The Company and some of its manufacturing vendors and component
suppliers have significant operations in various locations throughout Asia,
including locations in mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, and Singapore, all of which were subject to the World Health Organization
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) travel advisories at times during fiscal 2003. Similar travel
advisories were issued for Taiwan, where a significant amount of the Companys
portable Macintosh systems and the iPod are assembled. Should the severity of
the SARS threat increase or other public health issues arise, the Company could
be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel
restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services,
governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions,
delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations
of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers.

The market for
personal computers and related peripherals and services is highly competitive.
If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results
of operations could be adversely affected.
The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross
margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles,
evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance
characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by
competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of
competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for
personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense. The
Companys competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or
maintain market share in response to the weakness in demand that began in the
second half of calendar 2000 for personal computing products. The Companys
results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may
continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid
technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and
features based on existing or emerging industry standards.  Further, as the personal computer industry
and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of
Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal
computers may compete for market share with the Companys existing
products.  Several competitors of the
Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of
the Companys key market segments, including consumer, education, professional
and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the
Companys competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital
music products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and
solutions of the Companys products. The Company has a significant number of
competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and
technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed
customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend
towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in
larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Companys markets.
 
The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS.
The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which
is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsofts Windows operating
systems. The Companys future operating results and financial condition are
substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to
the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional
advantages over competing platforms, including Windows.
 
The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to
digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices including
iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting
their own digital music distribution services, free peer-to-peer music
services, emerging companies, and larger companies that may have greater
resources, including technical and marketing resources, and supplier
relationships. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets.
Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Companys operating
results and financial position.
 
The Company has
higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs,
as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors.
The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive
gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and
timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the
marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development
costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal
computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to
compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further,
as a result of the expansion of the Companys Retail segment and costs
associated with marketing the Companys brand including its unique operating
system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than
many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and
sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of
operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost
structure.
 
The Company must
successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions in order to
remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.
Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry,
which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid
technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and
 
31







 
technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive,
and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded
versions of the Companys existing products. The success of new product
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance;
the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
including production ramp issues; the availability of application software for
new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with
anticipated product demand; the availability of products in appropriate
quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have
quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the
Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will
have on its sales or results of operations.
 
During 2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac
OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. Other major
upgrades include Mac OS X Jaguar in 2002 and most recently Mac OS X Panther in
October 2003. Inability of the Company to provide additional improvements
in the performance and functionality of the Mac OS, inability to advance
customer acceptance of the operating system and its upgrades, inability to
obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing
applications to run on the Mac OS or create new applications to run on the Mac
OS, may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results and financial
condition.
 
Because orders for
components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be
placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory
risk.
The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and
products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or
net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of
orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes
its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and
unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no
assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and
related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material
effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
 
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will
forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or
insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry
practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal
purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in
customer demand patterns.
 
Future operating
results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a sufficient supply
of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited
sources.
Although most components essential to the Companys business are
generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including
microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or
limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM,
TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while
currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject
to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products
introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained
from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need
for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a
component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints
may exist until such time as the suppliers yields have matured. The Company
and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for
their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the
rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and
ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers
were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those
customized to meet the Companys requirements. If the supply of a key component
were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Companys
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys ability to produce and market competitive products is
also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole
suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh
computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors
with price/performance features that
 
32







 
compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors by
Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by
personal computers using other operating systems. Further, despite its efforts
to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of
its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz
rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh
systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other operating systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced
PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient
quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of
operations. In addition, currently IBM is the Companys sole supplier of the G5
processor used in current Power Macintosh products and Motorola is the sole
supplier of the G4 processor. The inability in the future of the Company to
obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive
price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Companys
results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Company relies
on third-party music content, which may not be available to the Company on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.
The Company contracts with third parties to offer their music content
to customers through the Companys iTunes Music Store. The Company pays
substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this
third-party music. Many of the Companys licensing arrangements with these
third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the
future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at
all.  Certain parties in the music
industry have announced their intent to consolidate their music distribution
operations, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required
to offer music content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. If the
Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of music content at
reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or expand its geographic reach
outside the United States, then sales and gross margins of the Companys iTunes
Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may
be adversely affected.
 
Third-party content providers and artists require that the Company
provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security
mechanisms.  If the requirements from
content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to
further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements.  There is no assurance that the Company will
be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a
timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse affect on the
Companys operating results and financial position.
 
The Company is
dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties,
many of whom are located outside of the United States.
Many of the Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by
third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its
transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may
lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct
control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such
diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market
conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least
initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service in the
event of product defects.  Any
unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to
arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect
the Companys future operating results and financial condition.
 
Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the
Companys manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork,
Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California,
Taiwan, Korea, the Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech
Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys
products and final assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable
products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party
vendors in Japan, Taiwan and China. If for any reason manufacturing or
logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic,
business, environmental, medical, political, or military conditions or events,
the Companys results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.
 
33







 
The Companys
products, from time to time, experience quality problems that can result in
decreased net sales and operating profits.
The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that
can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system
software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain
bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software.
Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from
third-parties that may be beyond its control. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and
software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of
reputation, and significant expense to remedy.
 
The Companys retail
initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment
and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
Through December 2003, the Company has opened 73 retail stores
including its first international store in Tokyo, Japan. The Companys retail
initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold
improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has
also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with
lease terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company could incur substantial
costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores.
Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and
financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail
segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs
and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the
Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason.
 
Certain of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve
as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate
marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique
design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more
investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Companys more
typical retail stores. The Company has opened four such stores and has one
under construction. Because of their location and size, these high profile
stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating
lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores.
Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with
total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to
$50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores
could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Companys results
of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could
also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to
retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the
Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail segments future
results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected,
and/or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of
operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that
could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things,
macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity;
inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation;
lack of consumer acceptance of the Companys retail approach; failure to
attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party
hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage
relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in
managing retail operations outside the United States; costs associated with
unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail
inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.
 
Unit sales of the
Companys professionally oriented desktop systems have declined over the past
several years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin.
Although net sales and unit sales of Power Macintosh systems increased
36% and 30%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same
period in 2003, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 13% during 2003 and
18% in 2002. In addition, Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a
percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 30% in 2001 to 22% and 25% in
2003 and the first quarter of 2004, respectively. The Company believes that
weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative
impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of
such systems. Also, it is likely that many of the Companys current and
potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are
most likely to utilize the Companys Power Macintosh systems, believe that the
relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company
utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by
other operating systems and translates to slower overall system performance. In
addition to the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power
Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the Companys overall gross
margin because Power Macintosh systems generally have higher individual gross
margins than the Companys other
 
34







 
Macintosh systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit
sales could adversely affect the Companys future net sales and gross margin.
If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully
recover, it could be difficult for the Company to improve its overall
profitability. While the Company has introduced faster Power Macintosh systems
utilizing 64-bit PowerPC G5 processors during 2003, there can be no assurance
that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net sales either in the
short or long term.
 
The Company faces
increasing competition in the U.S. education market.
Sales in
the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for
college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Net
sales in these markets fell to 13% of the Companys total net sales in the
first quarter of 2004 from 15% in the same quarter of 2003. Although net sales
in U.S. education as a percentage of the Companys total net sales has declined
in the first quarter of 2004 from the same quarter in 2003, the Company did
experience a year-over-year improvement in net sales and Macintosh unit sales
in the U.S. education channel of 20% and 8%, respectively.  Uncertainty in this channel remains as
several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their
intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could
negatively affect the Companys market share. In an effort to regain market
share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue
one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. The Companys 1:1 learning
solutions are a complete solution consisting of an iBook portable system for
every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central
server.  These 1:1 solutions and other
strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in
significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for
larger deals.  Although the Company
believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education
market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or
maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large
strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the
Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
The Companys future
operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other
resellers of the Companys products.
The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers,
national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute
products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many
of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major
markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain
resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells
its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores.
Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on narrow product margins
and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable
trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are
outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. The
Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if the
financial condition of these resellers weaken, if resellers within consumer
channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products, or if
uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers to
reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products.  The Company has invested and will continue
to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing
selected resellers stores with Company employees.  These programs could require a substantial investment from the
Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to
offset this investment.
 
Over the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys
net sales have been made by the Company directly to end-users through its
online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the United
States. Some of the Companys resellers have perceived this expansion of the
Companys direct sales as conflicting with their own business and economic
interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products. Perception
of such a conflict could discourage the Companys resellers from investing
additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or
lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Companys products. The
Companys business and financial results could be adversely affected if
expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers
to cease or limit distribution of the Companys products.
 
Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and
Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year
ended September 27, 2003 under the heading Markets and Distribution.
 
The Companys
business is subject to the risks of international operations.
A large portion of the Companys revenue is derived from its
international operations. As a result, the Companys operating results and
financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with
international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability,
tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign
 
35







 
subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased.
The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates
relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and
certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred
throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the
Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the
Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency
denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign
currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components,
negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries, and on
sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can
be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by
international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option
positions, and interest rate swap and option positions have been utilized by
the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates.  The use of
such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse
financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign
exchange or interest rates.
 
Further information related to the Companys global market risks may be
found in Part II, Item 7A of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended
September 27, 2003 under the subheading Foreign Currency Risk and may be
found in Part II, Item 8 of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended
September 27, 2003 at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
The Companys future
performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If
third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the
Companys hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Companys
products.
The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the
Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often
based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications
such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of
third-party application software for the Companys hardware products depends in
part on third-party developers perception and analysis of the relative
benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Companys
products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based
on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the
anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of
Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the
Companys financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by
the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision
to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to
question the Companys prospects in the personal computer market, developers
could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing
software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources
to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover,
there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software
for Mac OS X, the Companys operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own
software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of
software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive
software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a
variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and
education customers that could influence the decision of third-party software
developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products.
Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for
professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual
effects for large format film and video productions, professional music
production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding
and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management,
digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality
presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application
that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation,
spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.
 
In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into
patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of
five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related
to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was
required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer
products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and
 
36







 
Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce
future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the
Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to
be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base
for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of
key areas. Accordingly, Microsofts interest in producing application software
for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by
Microsofts perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating
system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the
Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and
results of operations. In June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no
longer develop new versions of Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsofts
decision to discontinue development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears
to have been influenced in part by the Companys introduction during 2003 of
its own web browser, Safari. It is unclear what impact, if any, Microsofts
decision to cease further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will
have on the Company. However, if customers chose not to purchase the Companys
products because Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform
or should websites fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet
Explorer, the Companys net sales and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.
 
The Companys
business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from
third parties, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected if
it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of
others.
Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property
obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or
renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business
methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry
practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable
terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be
available or available on acceptable terms.
 
Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current
extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is
possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Information regarding claims and litigation
involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters
is set forth in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the
2003 Form 10-K.  In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or
royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the
infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that
would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its
results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail
to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others described in Part II, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 3 of the 2003 Form 10-K for the year ended
September 27, 2003 or should several of these matters be resolved against
the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Company expects
its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of
reasons.
The Companys profit margins vary among its products and its
distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in
any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel
mix reflected in that periods net sales.
 
The typical
concentration of net sales in the third month of the Companys fiscal quarters
can adversely affect the Companys business and operating results.
The Company generally sells more products during the third month of
each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern
typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce
pressure on the Companys internal infrastructure during the third month of a
quarter and may adversely impact the Companys ability to predict its financial
results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as
lower-than-anticipated
 
37







 
demand for the Companys products, an internal systems failure, or
failure of one of the Companys key logistics, components suppliers, or
manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and
its results of operations and financial condition.
 
The Companys success
depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued
service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive
Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and
staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry
are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in
the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Companys employees are located.
The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism
for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Potential accounting
regulations requiring the expensing of stock options may impair the Companys future
ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation
costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully
attract and retain key personnel.
 
The Company is
subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance.
The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance
markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such
conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles,
and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability,
the Company does not have insurance coverage. 
For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its
insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost.
 
Business
interruptions could adversely affect the Companys future operating results.
The Companys major business operations are subject to interruption by
earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,
labor disputes, medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The
majority of the Companys research and development activities, its corporate
headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business
operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors,
are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake
insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Companys operating results and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a
major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.
 
Failure of the Companys information
technology systems and breaches in the security of data could adversely affect
the Companys future operating results.
Information
technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the
Companys ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially
causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or
shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer
or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns by
its implementation of sophisticated network security and internal control
measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data
security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations.
 
The Company is
exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as
economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its products through third-party computer
resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and
commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also
has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting
from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company.
While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to
credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance
that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding
losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to
improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company
will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial
condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The Company is
subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.
Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries
may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in
some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return
product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for
environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and
regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the
Company operates,
 
38







 
including various European Union member countries, Japan and
California.  Although the Company does
not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature
of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such
existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operation and financial position.
 
Changes in
accounting rules could adversely affect the Companys future operating results.
Financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation
by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who interpret and
create appropriate accounting regulations. A change from current accounting
regulations could have a significant effect on the Companys results of
operations and could impact the manner in which the Company conducts business.
 
Unanticipated
changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or
unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in
countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the
Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or
their interpretation.  In addition, the
Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly
assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations
to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no
assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an
adverse effect on the Companys operating results and financial condition.
 
The Companys stock
price may be volatile.
The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price
volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated
financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its
competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology
companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of
these companies. These factors, including lack of positive performance in the
Companys stock price, as well as general economic and political conditions and
investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting
and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market
price of the Companys stock in the future.
 
The Companys
acquisition activity could disrupt its ongoing business and may present risks
not contemplated at the time of the transaction.
The Company has acquired and may continue to acquire companies that
have products, services, personnel and technologies that complement the
Companys strategic direction and product roadmap. These acquisitions may
involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in
incorporating the acquired companies operations and technologies; distraction
of managements attention away from normal business operations; insufficient
revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with
acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due
diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies.  Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no
assurance can be given that the Companys previous or future acquisitions will
be successful and will not materially adversely affect business, operating
results or financial condition. The Company has generally paid cash for its
acquisitions. Should the Company issue its common stock or other equity related
purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders
percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted.
 
For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Companys
future results and financial condition, see Item 7, Managements Discussion
and Analysis - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
and Item 1, Business in the Companys 2003 Form 10-K.
 
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk profile has not changed significantly from
that described in the 2003 Form 10-K.
 
Interest Rate and
Foreign Currency Risk Management
To
ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys foreign exchange and
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and
opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and
option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,
from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the
effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no
assurance the
 
39







 
aforementioned
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic
exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating results
and financial position.
 
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of
the worlds leading industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and
expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest
rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest
earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as
well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure
the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return in
light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company
benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a
small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers
adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional
research and market information that supplements internal research used to make
credit decisions in the investment process.
 
During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal
amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC.
The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of
6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15,
2004.
 
The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and debt obligations
and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short-term
investments in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers
and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The
Companys general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the
safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash
equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three
months are classified as short-term investments. As of December 27, 2003,
approximately $694 million of the Companys short-term investments had
underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder all had
underlying maturities between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in
anticipation of credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management
of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior
to their stated maturities. The Company recognized no net gains or losses
during the first quarter of 2004 related to such sales and recognized net gains
of $9 million in the first quarter of 2003.
 
The Company sometimes enters into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with
financial institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate
interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its
fixed-rate interest expense on its debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the
Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.
The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to
reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program.  The Company entered into no interest rate
asset swaps during the first quarter of either 2004 or 2003 and had no open
interest rate asset swaps at December 27, 2003.
 
In prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps
with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps, which qualified as
accounting hedges, generally required the Company to pay a floating interest
rate based on the three or six month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate
of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts.  These swaps effectively converted the
Companys fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and converted a portion
of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market
interest rates, during 2002 the Company entered into and then subsequently
closed out debt swap positions realizing a gain of $6 million. During 2001 the
Company closed out all of its then existing debt swap positions realizing a
gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and 2001 were deferred, recognized
in long-term debt and are being amortized to other income and expense over the
remaining life of the debt.
 
Foreign Currency
Risk
Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the
U.S. dollar and, as such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is
adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide.
Accordingly,
 
40







 
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as
expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to
adjust local currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged
positions due to competitive pressures when there has been significant
volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts
with financial institutions primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally,
the Companys practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign
exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain
foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive
economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of
appropriate hedging instruments. The Company also enters into foreign currency
forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses
generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities
denominated in non-functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
Item 4. Controls and
Procedures
Based on
an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act))
were effective as of December 27, 2003 to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
 
There
were no significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting identified in managements evaluation during the first quarter of
fiscal 2004 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
 
41







 
PART II. OTHER
INFORMATION
 
Item 1. Legal
Proceedings
 
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
discussed below. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings
and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which have
not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not
have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims
that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain legal matters in the
first quarter of 2004, which did not individually or in the aggregate have a
material impact on the Companys results of operations.

complaint and the Company expects that they will make further amendments.  On October 29, 2003, the Company filed
a motion to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel in his role as counsel to the
purported class and to the general public. 
The Court granted the motion, but allowed Plaintiff to retain substitute
counsel.  Plaintiff did engage new
counsel for the general public, but not for the class.  The Company moved to disqualify Plaintiffs
new counsel and to have the Court dismiss the general public claims for
equitable relief.  The Court declined to
disqualify Plaintiffs new counsel or to dismiss the equitable claims, but did
confirm that the class action claims are dismissed.  The trial date is stayed pending a possible appeal.

Dynacore Holdings
Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff Dynacore filed this action on June 6, 2001 in United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company
and thirteen other defendants claiming patent infringement relating to IEEE
1394 technology, also known as FireWire. Plaintiff claims that any computer
system or other electronic product that uses or complies with the IEEE 1394
standard violates the patent. Plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other
relief. The Company has answered the complaint, denying all allegations and
asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The Company also asserted
counterclaims requesting declaratory judgment for non-infringement and
invalidity. Defendants are seeking to amend the pleading to assert a counterclaim
for inequitable conduct against Dynacore. The case was initially stayed pending
the Federal Circuits decision in Datapoint Corp. v. Standard Microsystems
Corp., a related case in which plaintiff claimed that its patent was infringed
by products complying with the fast Ethernet standard. In February 2002,
the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment of non-infringement in Datapoint, and
the District Court lifted the stay in this action. The defendants in this
action filed a joint motion for summary judgment based upon the decision in
Datapoint. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on
February 11, 2003.  Dynacore
appealed the ruling. The Federal Circuit Court heard argument on January 5,
2004.  The parties await a ruling.
 
East
Texas Technology Partners LP v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this patent infringement action
on January 23, 2004 in the United States District Court in the Eastern
District of Texas alleging infringement by the Company and seven other
defendants of patent 6,574,239 relating to virtual connection of a remote unit
to a server.  Plaintiff seeks
unspecified damages and other relief. 
The Company is investigating this claim.
 
Hawaii Structural Iron Workers and
Pension Trust Fund v. Apple Computer, Inc. and Steven P. Jobs; Young v. Apple
Computer, Inc. et al; Hsu v. Apple Computer Inc. et al
Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer.
These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf
of persons who purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege
violations of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified
compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes these claims are
without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion
to dismiss on June 4, 2002, which was heard by the Court on
September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002, the Court granted the
Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, with leave
to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint within thirty days. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court heard
the Companys motion on July 11, 2003 and dismissed Plaintiffs claims
with prejudice on August 12, 2003. 
Plaintiffs have appealed the ruling.
 
MacTech v. Apple Computer, Inc.;
Macadam v. Apple Computer, Inc.; Computer International, Inc. v. Apple
Computer, Inc.; Elite Computers and Software, Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.; The
Neighborhood Computer Store v. Apple Computer, Inc. (All in
Santa Clara County Superior Court).
Five resellers have filed similar lawsuits against the Company for
various causes of action including breach of contract, fraud, negligent and
intentional interference with economic relationship, negligent
misrepresentation, trade libel, unfair competition and false advertising.
Plaintiffs request unspecified damages and other relief.   The Company answered the Computer
International complaint on November 12, 2003 denying all allegations and
asserting numerous affirmative defenses. 
The Company expects the other four plaintiffs to file amended
complaints.  On October 1, 2003,
one of the resellers, Macadam was deauthorized as an Apple reseller. Macadam
filed a motion for a temporary order to reinstate it as a reseller, which the
Court denied.  The Court denied
Macadams motion for a preliminary injunction on December 19, 2003. The
parties are in discovery.
 
Palmieri v. Apple
Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this purported class action on September 5, 2003
in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of a nationwide class of
purchasers of certain PowerBooks.  The
case alleges violations of Civil Code Section 17200 (Unfair Competition)
and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) arising from an alleged design defect
in the PowerBooks which purportedly causes marks and dead pixels in the LCD
screens.  Plaintiffs amended their
complaint to allege an additional defect in the new 15 PowerBook, introduced
in September 2003, which purportedly causes white spots on the
screen.  The complaint seeks unspecified
damages and other relief.  The Company
filed an answer on January 8, 2004 denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  The
Company is investigating these allegations.

TIBCO Software, Inc.
v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff filed this case on August 27, 2003 in United States
District Court for the Northern District of California alleging trademark
infringement by the Company for using the mark Rendezvous. Plaintiffs mark
is TIBCO Rendezvous.  The complaint
seeks unspecified damages and other relief. 
The Company answered the complaint denying all allegations and asserting
numerous affirmative defenses.  The
Company also asserted counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment for
non-infringement, invalidity and no dilution. 
The case is in discovery.
 
UNOVA, Inc. v. Apple
Computer, Inc., et al.
Plaintiff
UNOVA filed this patent infringement action against the Company and six other
defendants on May 8, 2002 in the Central District of California for
infringement of eight UNOVA patents related to Smart Battery Management.
Plaintiff alleges that the Companys portable computers manufactured since 1996
infringe these eight patents. Plaintiff has filed similar lawsuits against
other companies in addition to the co-defendants in this case. Plaintiff seeks
unspecified damages and other relief. The Company has answered the complaint,
denying all allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The
Company also asserted counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment for
non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability.  The parties have reached a settlement. Settlement of the matter
did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results
of operations.
 
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the
Companys first fiscal quarter ended December 27, 2003.
