APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
 
Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
Note 1 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Apple Computer,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) designs, manufactures, and markets
personal computers and related personal computing and communicating solutions
for sale primarily to education, creative, consumer, and business customers.
 
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Interim information is unaudited;
however, in the opinion of the Companys management, all adjustments of a
normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of interim periods
presented have been included.  The
results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be
expected for the entire year.
 
These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in
conjunction with the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2002, included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2002 (the 2002 Form
10-K). Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters
refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters of those fiscal years.
 
Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations
On September 29, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs.  The standard applies
to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that
result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the
assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. 
The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life
of the asset. All of the Companys existing asset retirement obligations are
associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to
original condition upon lease termination. The Company estimated that as of
September 29, 2002, gross expected future cash flows of $9.5 million would be
required to fulfill these obligations.
 
As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $6 million long-term
asset retirement liability and a corresponding increase in leasehold
improvements. This amount represents the present value of expected future cash
flows associated with returning certain of the Companys leased properties to
original condition. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow
of $9.5 million and its present value at September 29, 2002, of $6 million will
be accreted over the life of the related leases as an operating expense.  Net of the related income tax effect of
approximately $1 million, adoption of SFAS No. 143 resulted in an unfavorable
cumulative-effect type adjustment to net income during the first quarter of
2003 of approximately $2 million. This adjustment represents cumulative
depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized through the date of
adoption of SFAS No. 143 had the statement been applied to the Companys
existing asset retirement obligations at the time they were initially incurred.
 
The following table reconciles changes in the Companys asset
retirement liability for the first nine months of 2003 (in millions):

Accounting
for Restructuring Charges
In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain
Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability
for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred, as opposed to when management is committed to an exit
plan.  SFAS No. 146 also establishes
that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value.
This Statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 were required to be applied
prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities.
 
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company
measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and has provided
pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if
the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense.
The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25 because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and
employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB No. 25, when the exercise price
of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
 
As required under
SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income
and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee
stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the
options vesting period and the shares plan period.
 
The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
freely traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and the Companys
expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options
and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly
different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of
the fair value of the Companys employee stock options and employee stock
purchase plan shares.
 
For purposes of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No.
123, the expected volatility assumptions used by the Company prior to the third
quarter of 2003 have been based solely on the historical volatility of the
Companys common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the
estimated expected life of the Companys stock options. Beginning in the third
quarter of 2003, the Company has modified this approach to consider other
relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the
Companys common stock and the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably
expected to recur on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock.
The Company will continue to monitor these and other relevant factors in
developing the expected volatility assumption used to value future awards.
 
Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the Company shortened its
estimate of the expected life of new options granted to its employees from 4
years to 3.5 years. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its
historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options it
grants to employees. The change in the expected life assumption made during the
third quarter of 2003 was the result of the expected impact of shortening the
contractual life of new options granted to employees from 10 years to 7 years
and changing the vesting provisions of new options granted to employees from 4
year straight-line annual vesting to 4 year straight-line quarterly vesting.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options
vesting period and the shares plan period. The Companys pro forma information

The Companys short-term investment portfolio consists of investments
in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, U.S. corporate securities, and foreign
securities. The Companys U.S. corporate securities consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, time deposits, and corporate debt
securities. Foreign securities consist primarily of foreign commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of
which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company had net unrealized gains on
its investment portfolio of $20 million as of September 28, 2002, and net
unrealized losses of $2 million as of June 28, 2003. The Company occasionally
sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of
such sales, the Company recognized gains of $3 million and $2 million during
the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Recognized gains on the sale of short-term investments were $21
million and $5 million during the first nine months of 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These gains were included in interest and other income, net.
 
7







 
As of June 28, 2003, and September 28, 2002, $338 million and $1.087
billion, respectively, of the Companys investment portfolio that was
classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5
years.  The remainder of the Companys
short-term investments had underlying maturities of between 3 and 12 months.
 
Non-Current
Debt and Equity Investments and Related Gains
The Company has held
significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc.
(EarthLink). These investments have been reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets as long term assets within other assets and have been categorized
as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these
investments have been included in interest and other income.  The combined fair value of these investments
held by the Company was $39 million as of September 28, 2002.
 
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold all of its remaining
holdings in both ARM and EarthLink, consisting of 278,000 shares of ARM stock
for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a gain before taxes of
$270,000, and 3,960,000 shares of Earthlink stock for net proceeds of
approximately $23 million, and a gain before taxes of $2 million. During the
first quarter of 2003, the Company sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for
net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, an amount that approximated the
Companys carrying value of the shares. As of June 28, 2003, the fair value of
the Companys remaining investment in Akamai was $14 million.
 
During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares
of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million.
During the first quarter of 2002, the Company also sold 250,000 shares of
Akamai and 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately
$2 million each and a gain before taxes of $710,000 and $223,000, respectively.
 
Debt
The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of
$300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that was
originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes,
along with approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred gains on
closed interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been
classified as current debt as of June 28, 2003.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Foreign currency forward and option
contracts are used to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain existing
assets and liabilities and to hedge the foreign exchange risk on expected
future cash flows on certain forecasted revenues and cost of sales. From time
to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the
interest rate profile of certain investments and debt. The Companys accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are
designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  As of the end of the third quarter of 2003, the general nature of
the Companys risk management activities and the general nature and mix of the
Companys derivative financial instruments have not changed materially from the
end of fiscal 2002.
 
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company enters
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
primarily to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and certain
probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys
practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange
transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign
exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost
of hedging particular exposures, or limited availability of appropriate hedging
instruments.
 
Interest
Rate Risk Management
The Company
sometimes enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest
rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better
match the Companys floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and
short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term
debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Companys exposure away from
fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also
 
8







 
enter into
interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest
rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such
financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.
 
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
On October 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value.
Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.
If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in
fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. As
of June 28, 2003, the Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow
hedges of approximately $4 million net of taxes, substantially all of which is
expected to be reclassified to earnings by the end of the first quarter of
fiscal 2004.

Inventory
Prepayment
In April 2002, the
Company made a $100 million prepayment to an Asian supplier for the purchase of
components over the following nine months. In return for this deposit, the
supplier agreed to supply the Company with a specified level of components
during the three consecutive fiscal quarters ending December 28, 2002.
Approximately $53 million of this deposit remained unused as of September 28,
2002 and was reflected in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets in other current assets. During the first six months of 2003,
the remainder of the deposit balance was fully utilized for the purchase of
components. The deposit was unsecured and had no stated interest
component. The Company imputed an amount to cost of sales and interest income
during each period the deposit was outstanding at a 3.25% interest rate to
reflect the economics of this transaction.
 
Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
The Company is
currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over
periods ranging from 3 to 7 years. The Company ceased amortization of goodwill
at the beginning of fiscal 2002 when it adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.

Note 4  Restructuring Actions
 
Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions
 
The Company
recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $27 million during the
nine months ended June 28, 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in
severance costs, a $5 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1
million in asset impairments and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations.
Of the $27 million, nearly all had been spent by the end of the third quarter
of 2003, except for approximately $500,000 of severance costs and approximately
$5.0 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. During
the third quarter of 2003, approximately $500,000 of the amount originally
accrued for lease cancellations was determined to be in excess due to the
sublease of a property sooner than originally estimated and an approximately
$500,000 shortfall was identified in the severance accrual due to higher than
expected severance costs related to the closure of the Companys Singapore
manufacturing operations. These adjustments had no net effect on reported
operating expense.
 
Q203 Restructuring Actions
During the second
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8
million, including $2.4 million in severance costs and $400,000 for asset
write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility. Actions taken in the
second quarter were for the most part supplemental to actions initiated in the
prior two quarters and focused on further headcount reductions in various sales
and marketing functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments
and further reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the
Americas operating segment, including an accrual for asset write-offs and lease
payments on an abandoned facility. The second quarter actions resulted in the
termination of 93 employees, 87 of who were terminated prior to the end of the
third quarter of 2003.
 
Except for certain costs associated with operating leases on the
abandoned facility, the Company currently anticipates that substantially all of
the remaining accrual for severance costs of approximately $300,000 will be
spent by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
Q103 Restructuring Actions
During the first
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of
manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further
reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product
strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various
sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These
restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260
positions worldwide, all but one of which were eliminated by the third quarter
of 2003.
 
Closure of the
Companys Singapore manufacturing operations resulted in severance costs of
$1.8 million and costs of $6.7 million to write-off manufacturing related fixed
assets, whose use ceased during the first quarter. PowerSchool related costs
included severance of approximately $550,000 and recognition of $5 million of
previously deferred stock compensation that arose when PowerSchool was acquired
by the Company in 2001 related to certain PowerSchool employee stockholders who
were terminated in the first quarter of 2003. Termination of sales and
marketing activities and employees, principally in the United States and
Europe, resulted in severance costs of $2.8 million and accrual of costs
associated with operating leases on closed facilities of $6.7 million. The
total net restructuring charge of $23 million recognized during the first
quarter of 2003 also reflects the reversal of $600,000 of unused restructuring
accrual originally made during the first quarter of 2002.
 
Except for certain costs
associated with operating leases on closed facilities, the Company currently
anticipates that all of the remaining accrual for severance costs of
approximately $200,000 will be spent by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003.

Fiscal
2002 Restructuring Actions
During fiscal
2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $30
million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better
align the Companys operating expenses with existing general economic
conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new
product development and investments in the Companys Retail operating segment.
 
Q402
Restructuring Actions
During the fourth
quarter of 2002, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions with a total cost of approximately $6 million designed to reduce
headcount costs in corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool
product strategy. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of
approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million, 176 of which
were eliminated by June 28, 2003. Eliminated positions were primarily in
corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development
in the Americas operating segment. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool
included discontinuing development and marketing of PowerSchools PSE product.
This shift resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development
costs associated with the PSE product in the amount of $4.5 million. As of June
28, 2003, substantially all of the severance accrual had been utilized, except
for insignificant severance and related costs associated with 4 remaining
employees identified for subsequent termination.
 
Q102
Restructuring Actions
During the first quarter of 2002, the Companys management approved and
initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million.
These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425
positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated
primarily in the Companys operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant
changes in the Companys information systems strategy resulting in termination
of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities.  The Company ceased using the assets
associated with first quarter 2002 restructuring actions during that same
quarter. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million,
and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. The first quarter 2002
restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity not
allocated to operating segments. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company
reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000.

Note 5 
Shareholders Equity
 
CEO Restricted Stock Award
On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an Option Cancellation and
Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the Agreement) with Steven P. Jobs, its Chief
Executive Officer (CEO).  The Agreement
cancelled stock option awards previously granted to Mr. Jobs in 2000 and 2001
for the purchase of 27.5 million common shares of the Companys common
stock.  Mr. Jobs retained options to purchase
60,000 shares of the Companys common stock granted in August of 1997 in his
capacity as a member of the Companys Board of Directors, prior to becoming the
Companys CEO.  The Agreement replaced
the cancelled options with a restricted stock award of 5 million shares of the
Companys common stock.  The restricted
stock award generally vests three years from date of grant. Vesting of some or
all of the restricted shares will be accelerated in the event Mr. Jobs is
terminated without cause, dies, or has his management role reduced following a
change in control of the Company.
 
The Company has recorded the value of the restricted stock award of
$74.75 million as a component of shareholders equity and is amortizing that
amount on a straight-line basis over the 3-year service/vesting period.  The value of the restricted stock award was
based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of
the award.  Quarterly amortization of
approximately $6.3 million is being recognized as an operating expense.  The 5 million restricted shares have been
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share utilizing the
treasury stock method.
 
Stock
Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for
the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan through
the end of fiscal 2000, the Company had repurchased a total of 5.05 million
shares at a cost of $191 million. No shares have been repurchased since the end
of fiscal 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a
forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in
September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of
$25.5 million. The total cost to acquire the same number of shares at the
closing price of the Companys common stock on June 28, 2003, would be
approximately $28.7 million. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an
additional $283 million of its common stock as of June 28, 2003.
 
Comprehensive
Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses,
gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net
income. The Companys other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign
currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S.
dollar as their functional currency, from unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and from net deferred
gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow
hedges.

Note 6 
Employee Benefit Plans
 
2003 Employee Stock Option Plan
At the Annual
Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24, 2003, the shareholders approved an
amendment to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan to change the name of the
plan to the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 2003 Plan), to provide for
broad-based grants to all employees in addition to executive officers and other
key employees and to prohibit future repricings of employee stock options,
including 6-months-plus-1-day option exchange programs, without shareholder
approval. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under
the 2003 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally
become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment,
with either annual or quarterly vesting. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights.
 
14







 
1997 Employee Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the
Companys Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the
1997 Plan), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the
1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under
the 1997 Plan generally expire 7 to 10 years after the grant date and generally
become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment,
with either annual or quarterly vesting. As a result of shareholder approval of
amendments to the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan in April 2003, the Company
will terminate the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan and cancel all remaining
unissued shares, following the completion of the employee stock option exchange
program in October 2003.
 
Employee
Stock Option Exchange Program
On March 20, 2003, the Company announced a voluntary employee stock
option exchange program (the Exchange Program) whereby eligible employees,
other than executive officers and members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity
to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices at or above $25.00 per
share for a predetermined smaller number of new stock options issued with
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of one share of the Companys
common stock on the day the new awards are issued, which will be at least six
months plus one day after the exchange options are cancelled.  On April 17, 2003, in accordance with the
Exchange Program, the Company accepted and cancelled options to purchase
16,569,193 shares of its common stock and granted a promise to issue
approximately 6,892,309 new options to participating employees. The new stock
options will be issued on October 20, 2003, which is the first business day
that is six months and one day after cancellation of the exchanged options. No
financial or accounting impact to the Companys financial position, results of
operations or cash flow for the three months ended June 28, 2003, was
associated with this transaction.
 
1997 Director Stock Option Plan
In August 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a
shareholder approved Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP) for non-employee
directors of the Company. Initial grants of 30,000 options under the DSOP vest
in three equal installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of
the date of grant, and subsequent annual grants of 10,000 options are fully
vested at grant.
 
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has a
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under
which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of
the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases
under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employees compensation, up to
a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. 
During the first nine months of 2003, approximately 2.1 million shares
were issued under the Purchase Plan.  In
the third quarter of 2003, the Companys shareholders also approved an
amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance by 4 million shares. As of June 28, 2003, approximately
4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.  Beginning with the six-month offering period
that started on June 30, 2003, the number of shares authorized for issuance is
limited to a total of 1 million shares per offering period.

Note 7 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company has
provided pro forma disclosures in Note 1 of these Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of the effect on net income and earnings per
share as if the fair value method of accounting for stock compensation had been
used for its employee stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan
purchases. These pro forma effects have been estimated at the date of grant and
beginning of the period, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model.
 
For purposes of
the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123, the option awards
expected to be issued in October 2003 and the awards cancelled as part of the
Employee Stock Option Exchange Program have been accounted for using
modification accounting.  In accordance
with SFAS No. 123, the grant date of the awards to be issued is the date of
acceptance of the exchange offer by participating employees.  The cancellation of certain of the Companys
Chief Executive Officers options and replacement with restricted shares in
March 2003 is also being accounted for using modification accounting for purposes
of the pro forma disclosures provided pursuant to SFAS No. 123.
 
The assumptions
used for the three and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2003, and June 29,
2002, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per
share of options granted and for stock purchases during those periods are as

Note 8 
Commitments and Contingencies
 
Lease Commitments
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail
space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not
currently utilize any other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. The major
facility leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal
options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for
terms of 5 to 14 years and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 28, 2002, the Companys total future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases were $464 million, of which $209 million related
to leases for retail space.  As of June
28, 2003, total future minimum lease payments related to leases for retail
space increased to $304 million.
 
Accrued
Warranty and Indemnifications
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its
hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically
one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a
90-day basic warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used
to repair Apple hardware products. The Company provides currently for the
estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties
at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the
installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical warranty
claim rates, historical cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. The Company
assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the
amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future
expectations.

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating
system and application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other licensing agreements
entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under
which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting
from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified
third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential
liability related to unresolved infringement claims that would have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of
either June 28, 2003, or September 28, 2002.
 
Contingencies
Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer.
These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf
of persons who purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the
1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and
other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends
to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4,
2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002,
the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause
of action, with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company
filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A hearing on the Companys
motion was held on July 11, 2003, and the Court has yet to rule on the matter.
 
The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims
that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a
potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or
results of operations. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these
legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the
Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The parliament of the European Union has finalized the Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes
producers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially
responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future
products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual
European Union governments by August 13, 2004, while the producers financial
obligations are scheduled to start August 13, 2005. The Companys potential
liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products
and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial.
However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement
policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it
is not currently possible to estimate the Companys existing liability or
future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its
individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with
respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential
financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies,
including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative
impact of which could be significant.
 
18







 
Note 9 -
Segment Information and Geographic Data
 
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan. The Retail segment currently operates Apple-owned
retail stores in the United States. Other operating segments include
Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the
Companys subsidiary, FileMaker, Inc. Each reportable geographic operating
segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services,
and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1, except
as described below for the Retail segment.
 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based
on net sales. The Retail segments performance is also evaluated based on
operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location
of the customers. Operating income for each segment includes revenue from third
parties, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
segment. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
and certain expenses that are managed outside the operating segments. Costs
excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses,
manufacturing costs not included in standard costs, income taxes, and various
nonrecurring charges. Corporate expenses include research and development,
corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and
administrative expenses including certain corporate expenses associated with
support of the Retail segment. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets
exclude corporate assets. Corporate assets include cash, short-term and
long-term investments, manufacturing facilities, miscellaneous corporate
infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and retail store
construction-in-progress that is not subject to depreciation. Except for the
Retail segment, capital expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Capital expenditures by the Retail segment were $30
million and $60 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2003,
respectively. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2002, capital
expenditures by the Retail segment were $16 million and $67 million,
respectively.
 
Operating income for all segments, except Retail, includes cost of
sales at standard cost. Certain manufacturing expenses and related adjustments
not included in segment cost of sales, including variances between standard and
actual manufacturing costs and the mark-up above standard cost for product
supplied to the Retail segment, are included in corporate expenses.
 
To assess the operating performance of the Retail segment several
significant items are included in its results for internal management reporting
that are not included in results of the Companys other segments. First, cost
of sales for the Retail segment includes a mark-up above the Companys standard
cost to approximate the price normally charged to the Companys resellers
operating retail stores in the United States. For the third quarter of 2003 and
the third quarter of 2002, this resulted in the recognition of additional cost
of sales above standard cost by the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to
corporate expenses of approximately $25 million and $11 million, respectively.
For the first nine months of 2003 and the first nine months of 2002, this
resulted in the recognition of additional cost of sales above standard cost by
the Retail segment and an offsetting benefit to corporate expenses of
approximately $71 million and $32 million, respectively.
 
Second, the Retail segment includes in its net sales proceeds from
sales of the Companys extended warranty and support contracts and also
recognizes related cost of sales based on the amount such contracts are
normally sold to the Companys resellers operating retail stores in the United
States. This treatment is consistent with how the Companys major resellers
account for the sales and cost of the Companys extended warranty and support
contracts. Because the Company has not yet earned the revenue or incurred the
costs associated with the sale of these contracts, an offset to these amounts
is recognized in the Americas segments net sales and cost of sales. For the
third quarter of 2003, this resulted in the recognition of net sales and cost
of sales by the Retail segment, with corresponding offsets in the Americas
segment, of $7.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively. For the third quarter
of 2002, the net sales and cost of sales recognized by the Retail segment for
sales of extended warranty and support contracts were $2.0 million and $1.4
million, respectively. For the first nine months of 2003, this resulted in the
recognition of net sales and cost of sales by the Retail segment, with
corresponding offsets in the Americas segment, of $19.3 million and $13.2
million, respectively. This compares to similar adjustments to net sales and
cost of sales during the first nine months of 2002 of $5.0 million and $3.5
million, respectively.
 
19







 
Third, a portion of the operating expenses associated with certain high
profile retail stores is allocated from the Retail segment to corporate
marketing expense. Allocation of these expenses reflects the unique nature of
these stores which, given their larger size and extraordinary design elements,
function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate sales and
marketing events, and brand awareness. 
Allocated operating costs are those in excess of operating costs
incurred by one of the Companys more typical retail locations. Stores were
open in three such high profile locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago
as of June 28, 2003. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from
the operations of these stores were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2003
and $3.3 million for the nine-months ended June 28, 2003. These costs were not
significant during the first nine months of 2002.

Note 10
- - Earnings Per Share
 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been
issued. The
 
20







 
dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock is
reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
method.
 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except net income and per share
amounts):

Options to purchase approximately 51 million and 45 million shares of
common stock that were outstanding at June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002,
respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share for the quarters then ended because the options exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of the Companys common stock during
those quarters, and therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive.

Critical
Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Companys discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the
Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect
the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the
Companys 2002 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.
 
Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies are
those related to revenue recognition, allowance
for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and exposures related to inventory
purchase commitments, valuation of long-lived assets including acquired
intangibles, and valuation of non-current debt and equity investments.
Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both
important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results,
and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that
are inherently uncertain. Additional information about these critical
accounting policies may by found in the Companys 2002 Form 10-K in Item 7, Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading
Critical Accounting Policies.
 
Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently measures compensation expense for its employee
stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and provides pro forma disclosures of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense. The Company has elected to follow
APB No. 25 because, as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements provided in this Form 10-Q, the alternative
fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under
APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Companys employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the
grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided on April 22,
2003 to require all companies to expense the value of employee stock options.
Companies will be required to measure the cost of employee stock options
 
23







 
according to their fair value. The FASB has indicated that it plans to
issue in the near future an exposure draft of a new accounting standard
addressing this matter. This new accounting standard could become effective as
early as 2004. Prior to issuance of this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated
it will be addressing several significant technical issues. Among other things,
the FASB must determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will
permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and
actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and
amount of compensation expense recognized. Also, a method to determine the fair
value of employee stock options must be established. Current accounting
standards require use of an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes
model, to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the
input factors used in the model. This valuation approach has received
significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a
significant impact on the calculated fair value of employee stock options under
the new standard.
 
At the Companys annual shareholders meeting on April 24, 2003,
shareholders approved a proposal requesting that the Companys Board of Directors
(the Board) establish a policy of expensing the value of all future employee
stock options issued by the Company. The Board and management appreciate and
take seriously the views expressed by the Companys shareholders. As discussed
in the Companys Form 10-Q for the period ended March 29, 2003, the Company had
decided not to expense the value of employee stock options until the FASB
finalizes its new accounting standard on the matter. The Company based this
decision on the FASBs announced intention to soon require all companies to
expense the value of employee stock options and the FASBs near-term review of
technical issues that will play a significant role in determining the fair
value of and accounting for employee stock options. The Company monitors
progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue
of employee stock compensation. Further, the Company is evaluating its current
employee compensation programs. In the future, should the Company expense the
value of employee stock options, either out of choice or due to new
requirements issued by the FASB, and/or decide to alter its current employee
compensation programs to provide other benefits in place of options, including
restricted stock grants or additional cash bonuses, the Company may have to
recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could
have a material adverse impact on the Companys future results of operations.
 
Internet
Services Update
In April 2003, the Company launched the iTunes® Music Store in the
United States, an online music store that allows customers to find, purchase,

Business
Outlook
For
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company expects a high single-digit percentage
increase in net sales from the third quarter and a slight sequential increase
in quarterly earnings. The Company expects fourth quarter gross margin to be
approximately 100 basis points lower than the third quarter due to lower Mac OS
sales and increased manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up
of new Power Mac G5 systems. Fourth quarter reported operating expenses are
expected to be approximately $420 million. 
This excludes approximately $10 million of software development costs
related to development of Mac OS X Panther that the Company anticipates
capitalizing during the fourth quarter. The Company expects fourth quarter interest
and other income, net to decline to approximately $10 million due to lower
interest yields on the Companys investment portfolio. The Companys expects
its effective tax rate to remain at 28% during the fourth quarter.
 
The
foregoing statements concerning the Companys fourth quarter 2003 anticipated
net sales, gross margin, operating expenses, interest and other income,
net, effective tax rate, earnings,
capitalized software development costs, Mac OS sales, and production ramp
expenses are forward-looking. The Companys actual results could differ. The
Companys future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon
general economic conditions, market conditions within the PC industry, and the
Companys ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market
technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions
within the highly competitive market for personal computers. Some of the
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Companys future
operating results and financial condition are discussed throughout this Item 2,
including the discussion under the heading below Factors That May Affect
Future Results and Financial Condition, and in the 2002 Form 10-K.

Net
sales during the third quarter of 2003 increased 8% or $116 million from the
same period in 2002, and increased 4% or $193 million for the first nine months
of fiscal 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. Several factors have
contributed favorably to net sales during both the third quarter and the first
nine months of 2003 including:
 
                  Net sales of peripherals and other hardware
rose $137 million or 93% during the third quarter of 2003 compared to the same
quarter in 2002 and rose $238 million or 49% for the first nine months of 2003.
These increases are the result of significant year-over-year increases in
quarterly and year-to-date iPod net sales experienced in all of the Companys
operating segments. iPod sales during the third quarter of 2003 were favorably
affected by introduction of substantially redesigned new models during the
quarter and by the Companys introduction of its iTunes Music Store. Net sales of peripherals and other hardware
during 2003 also reflect an overall increase in net sales of other computer
accessories, the majority of which was experienced by the Companys Americas,
Europe, and Retail segments.
 
                  Net
sales of software rose $26 million or 41% during the third quarter of 2003
compared to the same quarter in 2002 and rose $73 million or 37% for the first
nine months of 2003. These increases reflect higher net sales of Apple-branded
application software, Mac OS X client and server software, and third-party
software. Net sales of Apple-branded software during the first nine months of
2003 was favorably affected by several new software titles including Final Cut
Express, iLife, Keynote, and titles acquired by the Company from Emagic during the
fourth quarter of 2002. Growth in net sales of third-party software was
particularly strong in the Retail segment for the third quarter and first nine
months of 2003.
 
                  Service
and other net sales rose $19 million or 33% during the third quarter of 2003
compared to the same quarter in 2002 and rose $30 million or 17% for the first
nine months of 2003. These increases are the result of significant
year-over-year increases in quarterly and year-to-date net sales associated
with AppleCare and related services and increases in net sales associated with
Internet services. Increased net sales associated with AppleCare are primarily
the result of higher attach rates on AppleCare protection plans over the last
several years. Increased net sales associated with Internet services are due
primarily to introduction of the iTunes Music Store during the third quarter of
2003 and increased net sales from the Companys .Mac Internet service.
 
                  The
Retail segments net sales grew to $428 million during the first nine months of
2003 from $181 million during the same period in 2002, a 136% increase. The
Retail segments 2003 third quarter net sales rose $82 million or 130% from the
third quarter of 2002. While the Companys customers in areas where the Retail
segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores
rather than the Companys preexisting sales channels in the United States, the
Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segments net sales
is incremental to the Companys total net sales. See additional comments below
related to the Retail segment under the heading Segment Operating
Performance.
 
                  Although
total Macintosh unit sales were down 6% during the first nine months of 2003
compared to the same period in 2002, unit sales of portable systems have been
relatively strong. PowerBook unit sales were up 71% and 43% during the first
three and nine months of 2003 versus the same periods in 2002,
respectively.  iBook unit sales were up
12% and 3% during the first three and nine months of 2003 versus the same
periods in 2002, respectively. Increased sales of portable systems reflect an
overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Portable systems
represented a record high 46% of all Macintosh systems sold during the third
quarter of 2003. Additionally, new PowerBook models introduced during the first
six months of 2003, including two new form factors featuring 12-inch and
17-inch displays and the Companys first portable product capable of burning
DVDs, have been well received by customers.
 
Offsetting the favorable
factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during the third quarter and
first nine months of 2003 were negatively impacted by three notable factors.
 
                  Total unit sales of desktop systems fell 23% and
18% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2003 compared to the same
periods in 2002. Unit sales of iMac systems were down 24% during the third
quarter of 2003 versus the same quarter in 2002 and were down 15% for the first
9 months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. iMac sales have been
negatively affected by the shift in sales away from desktop systems in favor of
portables. Also, the current flat panel iMac form factor is in the seventh
quarter of its life cycle.
 
30







 
                  Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 20%
during the third quarter of 2003 and 24% during the first nine months of 2003
compared to the same periods in 2002. These declines in unit sales of Power
Macintosh systems are consistent with the declining sales of Power Macintosh
systems experienced by the Company during recent years. In part, declines in
Power Mac sales reflect the shift in sales to portable models, particularly
PowerBooks. Also, the Company continues to believe that weak economic
conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact
on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers
continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Companys
ongoing transition to Mac OS X, customer perception of microprocessor clock
speed on overall system performance, and in anticipation of the introduction of
Power Mac G5 systems that were announced in June 2003 and are currently
expected to begin shipping to customers during the fourth quarter of 2003.
Additionally, some of the Companys professional and creative customers may be
delaying upgrades of their systems in anticipation of certain software vendors
transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications,
such as QuarkXPress, to run natively in Mac OS X. However, the Company did not
experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected
following the introduction of Adobes PhotoShop 7 for Mac OS X during 2002.
 
                  The Company has experienced ongoing weakness in
its U.S. education channel during the first nine months of 2003. Net sales in
U.S. education during the first nine months of 2003 were down approximately 3%
from the same period in 2002.  Further,
although the Company was encouraged that unit sales in U.S. education grew 5%
during the third quarter of 2003 compared to the same quarter in 2002, net
sales for the quarter were slightly down on a year-over-year basis. Despite the
year-over-year increase in unit sales for the third quarter of 2003 in the U.S.
education channel, net sales declined primarily as a result of a shift in mix
away from higher priced Power Mac and iMac systems towards lower priced eMac
and iBook systems. The Company believes weakness in its U.S. education channel
has been caused by multiple factors including funding pressures due to weak
economic conditions, large budget deficits in many states, and due to increased
competition. Although the Company did experience growth in quarterly unit sales
during the third quarter of 2003 and has taken steps, and will continue to take
steps, to address weakness in the U.S. education channel, it remains difficult
to anticipate when and if this negative trend will reverse.
 
                  The personal computer industry in general, and the
Company specifically, continue to see relatively soft demand for their
products. Sales of professional and consumer oriented Macintosh systems remain
far below levels experienced in fiscal 2000 and earlier. Worsening global
economic conditions over the past three years exacerbated by the economic and
political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated
international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the
overall demand for the Companys products in virtually all of its markets.
Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has slowed due to the
high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer,
creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. In summary, the
Company believes that expansion in the overall market for personal computers
has slowed and that significant growth continues to await a combination of
economic recovery and meaningful technological advancements.
 
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Companys reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America,
except for the activities of the Companys Retail segment. The Europe segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan.  The Retail
segment currently operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Each
reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys
operating segments may be found in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, Segment Information
and Geographic Data.
 
Americas
Net sales in the Americas segment during the third
quarter of 2003 increased  $14 million
or 2% compared to the same quarter in 2002, and declined $3 million for the
first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. Both the
quarterly and year-to-date results of the Americas segment are similar to the
overall results of the Company as they reflect substantially lower unit sales
and net sales of Power Macintosh systems and iMac systems partially offset by
significant increases in unit sales and net sales of PowerBooks. The net sales
of the Americas
 
31







 
segment, and the Company in total, also reflect
substantially higher sales of peripherals, software, and services during the
third quarter and first nine months of 2003 versus the same periods in 2002.
The Americas segment has been negatively affected by weakness in its U.S.
education channel. As noted above, the Company was encouraged that unit sales
in U.S. education grew 5% during the third quarter of 2003 compared to the same
quarter in 2002. However, total net sales and unit sales in the U.S. education
channel during the first nine months of 2003 were down 3% and 2%, respectively,
compared to the same period in 2002. The Company believes the cause for this
decline is that U.S. educational institutions appear to have reduced or
postponed capital spending due to federal and state funding concerns and tax
revenue shortfalls resulting from the weak economy and that competition in this
market is increasing. Additionally, some of the decline during 2003 in net
sales and unit sales of Macintosh systems in the Americas segment may be the
result of the operation of the Companys Retail segment whose net sales, all of
which occur within the U.S., increased significantly during the nine months of
2003.
 
Europe
Net sales in Europe increased $22 million or 8%
during the third quarter of 2003 as compared to the same quarter in 2002, and
decreased $17 million or 2% during the first nine months of 2003 as compared to
the same period in 2002.  Total
Macintosh unit sales in Europe for the three and nine-month periods ended June
28, 2003, were both down 10%. Europe has experienced weakened demand for Power
Macintosh and iMac systems in 2003 and strong demand for PowerBooks,
peripherals, and software. Demand for PowerBooks was particularly strong in
Europe during the third quarter of 2003.
 
Japan
Net sales in the Japan segment during the third quarter of 2003 were
flat at $168 million as compared to the same quarter in 2002. However, net
sales in Japan decreased $51 million or 9% during the first nine months of 2003
as compared to the same period in 2002, the weakest year-to-date performance in
2003 of any of the Companys operating segments. Japans Macintosh unit sales
have been particularly weak in 2003, declining 13% and 19% during the third
quarter and first nine months of 2003, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2002. Japans Macintosh unit
sales remain significantly below the segments historic levels due to current
economic conditions that remain particularly negative in Japan. Further,
while Japan has experienced substantial increases in net sales of both other
hardware and software, these increases were somewhat less than those
experienced by the Companys other operating segments.
 
Retail
The
Company opened three new retail stores during the third quarter of 2003,
bringing the total number of open stores to 59 as of the end of the third
quarter of 2003. This compares to 31 stores as of the end of the third quarter
of 2002. The Retail segments net sales grew to $428 million during the
first nine months of 2003 from $181 million during the same period in 2002, a
136% increase. Third quarter net sales in 2003 grew 130% from the same quarter
in 2002 and rose $10 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2003. The Retail segment has contributed strongly to
the increases in net sales of computer peripherals and software experienced by
the Company during 2003. During the first nine months of 2003, approximately
44% of the Retail segments net sales came from the sale of Apple-branded and
third-party peripherals and software. This compares to 27% for the Company as a
whole.
 
As
measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment lost
$6 million during the first nine months of 2003 compared to $18 million during
the same period in 2002. This improvement is primarily attributable the
segments year-over-year increase in net sales.
 
Expansion
of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial
investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease
commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated
with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $198 million through the
end of fiscal 2002, and totaled $60 million during the first nine months of
2003. As of June 28, 2003, the Retail segment had approximately 1,200 employees
and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store
space and related facilities of $304 million. The Company would incur
substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close
individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of
operations and financial condition. Investment
in a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky,
particularly in light of the significant investment involved, the current
economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail
segments operating expenses. Results for this segment are dependent
upon a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed below
under the heading Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial
Condition.

Gross margin for
the first nine months of 2003 was 27.9% compared to 28.4% for the same period
in 2002. The year-over-year decline in gross margin during the first nine
months of 2003 reflects relatively aggressive pricing beginning in late fiscal
2002 on several Macintosh models and lower sales of relatively higher margin
Power Macintosh systems partially offset by a higher mix of higher margin
portable products, peripherals, and software.
 
As noted above, the Company expects
fourth quarter gross margin to be approximately 100 basis points lower than the
third quarter due to lower sales of the Macintosh operating system and
increased manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of new
Power Mac G5 systems. However, the Companys gross margin and the gross
margin of the personal computer industry are expected to remain under pressure
during upcoming quarters in light of weak economic conditions, flat demand for
personal computers in general, price competition in the PC industry, and
potential increases in component pricing.
 
The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin
during the fourth quarter of 2003, general demand for personal computers,
anticipated industry component pricing, and future economic conditions are
forward-looking. Gross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of
several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection
entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. There
can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted
gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual
products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on
individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a
variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures,
increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in
the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services,
and potential changes to the Companys product mix, including higher unit sales
of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins.
In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue
to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also
be affected by the Companys ability to effectively manage product quality and
warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The
Companys operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes
in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Companys results of
operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in
exchange rates.
 
The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in
advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will
forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or
insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Companys
operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the
future be materially adversely affected by the Companys ability to manage its
inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term
shifts in customer demand patterns.

Research
and Development (R&D)
Expenditures for
research and development increased 13% and 9% for the three and nine month
periods ending in June of 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002. These
increases were primarily the result of increased R&D headcount to support
expanded R&D activities. The Company has continued to expand R&D even
though its net sales and profitability are under pressure. The Company has
historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. The Companys
management believes that maintaining or increasing the pace of innovation and
product development is the best way to respond to current economic and market
conditions and will better position the Company for future growth when
conditions improve.
 
Selling,
General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)
SG&A increased
10% and 8% during the third quarter of 2003 and for the first nine months of
fiscal 2003, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2002. Increased
SG&A is primarily the result of increased selling expenses associated with
the expanded operations of the Companys Retail segment partially offset by a
decline in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising and by savings
resulting from the restructuring activities described below.
 
Restructuring
Costs
During the second
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions that resulted in recognition of a total restructuring charge of $2.8
million. The primary focus of actions taken in the second quarter were for the
most part supplemental to actions initiated in the prior two quarters and
focused on further headcount reductions in various sales and marketing
functions in the Companys Americas and Europe operating segments and further
reductions associated with PowerSchool-related activities in the Americas
operating segment. The second quarter actions resulted in recognition of
severance costs of $2.4 million for termination of 93 employees, 87 of who were
terminated prior to the end of the third quarter of 2003 at a cost of $2.1
million. During the second quarter of 2003, an additional $400,000 was accrued
for asset write-offs and lease payments on an abandoned facility in the
Americas operating segment. Once fully implemented, the Company estimates these
restructuring actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $1.5 million.
 
During the first
quarter of 2003, the Companys management approved and initiated restructuring
actions with a total cost of $24 million that resulted in the termination of
manufacturing operations at the Company-owned facility in Singapore, further
reductions in headcount resulting from the shift in PowerSchool product
strategy that took place at the end of fiscal 2002, and termination of various
sales and marketing activities in the United States and Europe. These
restructuring actions will ultimately result in the elimination of 260
positions worldwide, all but one of which were eliminated by the third quarter
of 2003. Once fully implemented, the Company estimates these restructuring
actions will reduce quarterly operating expenses by $6 million.
 
During the first quarter of 2002, the Companys management approved and
initiated restructuring actions with a total cost of approximately $24 million.
These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 425
positions worldwide at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated
primarily in the Company operations, information systems, and administrative
functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant
changes in the Companys information systems strategy resulting in termination
of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities.
Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and
charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. During the first quarter of
2003, the Company reversed the remaining unused accrual of $600,000. The first
quarter 2002 restructuring actions were primarily related to corporate activity
not allocated to operating segments and have eliminated approximately $8.5
million of quarterly operating expenses.

Gains and Losses
on Non-current Investments
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold 278,000 shares of
ARM Holdings plc (ARM) stock for net proceeds of approximately $295,000, and a
gain before taxes of $270,000.  During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company also sold 3,960,000 shares of EarthLink,
Inc. (EarthLink) stock for net proceeds of approximately $23 million, and a
gain before taxes of $2 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company
sold 2,580,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of approximately
$13.7 million, an amount that approximated the Companys carrying value of the
shares sold.
 
During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold 4.7 million shares
of ARM stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company also sold 250,000 shares of Akamai
Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net
proceeds of approximately $2 million each and a gain before taxes of $710,000
and $223,000, respectively.
 
Interest and
Other Income, Net
Total interest and other income, net decreased $9 million or 35% to
$17 million during the third quarter of 2003 compared to the same quarter
in 2002 and decreased $41 million or 37% for the first nine months of 2003 from
the same period in 2002. These decreases are attributable primarily to
declining investment yields on the Companys cash and short-term investments
resulting from lower market interest rates and the closing out of longer-term
investments in favor of investments with shorter maturities. Declines in
investment yields were partially offset by gains on the sale of short-term
investments. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to
their stated maturities. The sale of short-term investments during the first
nine months of 2003 was intended to shorten the average maturity of the
Companys investment portfolio based on managements belief that interest rates
are at or near their bottom. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized
net gains of $3 million during the third quarter of 2003 and $2 million during
the third quarter of 2002. Such gains were $21 million and $5 million during
the first nine months of fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
Interest expense consists primarily of interest on the Companys
$300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes partially offset
by amortization of deferred gains realized in 2002 and 2001 that resulted from
the closure of swap positions associated with the unsecured notes. The unsecured
notes, which mature in February of 2004, were sold at 99.925% of par for an
effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the
closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million, $7 million of which
remained unamortized as of June 28, 2003, is being amortized over the remaining
life of the unsecured notes at a rate of approximately $2.8 million per
quarter.
 
As noted above, the Company currently expects interest and other
income, net to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2003 to
approximately $10 million as the impact of
declining interest rates and the repositioning of the Companys cash portfolio
to shorter-term maturities impact earnings on the Companys investment
portfolio. The foregoing statements are forward-looking. Interest and
other income, net, in the fourth quarter of 2003 could differ from expected
levels because of several factors, including certain of those set forth below
in the subsection entitled
 
35







 
Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. Additionally, actual future interest and other
income, net could be significantly impacted by unforeseen changes in market
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, by sales of short-term
investments, and by future changes in the fair value of the Companys
short-term and long-term investments.
 
Provision
for Income Taxes
The Companys
effective tax rate for the three and nine-month periods ended June 28, 2003 was
approximately 28%. The Companys 2003 effective rate differs from the statutory
federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign
earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings will
be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and due to the research and
development credit.
 
As noted above, the Company currently believes that its effective tax
rate for the remainder of fiscal 2003 will be approximately 28%. The foregoing
statement is forward-looking. The Companys future tax rate could differ
because of several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection
entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition. The
Companys actual future tax rate may be impacted by the amount and jurisdiction
of foreign profits or any changes to applicable tax laws and regulations.
 
On April 10, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its
audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 1998 through
2000 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being
contested through the IRS Appeals Office. 
Substantially all IRS audit issues for years prior to 1998 have been
resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any
adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the
Companys tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income
tax in the period such resolution occurs.
 
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
On May 15, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity.  SFAS No. 150
requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances)
three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for
the issuer. Generally, SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003.  The Company expects to adopt the provisions
of SFAS No. 150 on June 29, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 150 is expected to
result in a favorable cumulative effect type adjustment of approximately $3
million, all of which is related to a forward repurchase agreement that
requires the Company to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in
September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of
$25.5 million. Any fluctuation in the fair value of this forward repurchase
agreement that occurs prior to its maturity in September 2003 will be reflected
in other income and expense.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and applied immediately to any variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest
entities in which an interest is obtained after that date.  For variable
interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual
period beginning after June 15, 2003. While it will continue to evaluate
the requirements of FIN 46, the Company does not currently believe adoption
will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
 
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.  FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantors
balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. 
In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an
entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entitys
product warranty liabilities.  The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002.  The disclosure requirements of
FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending
after December 15, 2002.  The Company
has adopted the disclosure requirements for its financial statements included
in this Form 10-Q.  The provisions
related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply
to product warranties or to indemnification provisions in the Companys
software license arrangements.  However,
the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various
provisions of this pronouncement with the objective of providing
 
36







 
additional guidance on its application.  These discussions and the issuance of any new interpretations,
once finalized, could lead to an unanticipated impact on the Companys future
financial results.  Therefore, although
the Company currently does not believe these provisions will have a material
effect on its operating results or financial position, it will continue to
evaluate the impact of FIN 45. 
Currently, the only significant guarantees issued by the Company to
third parties within the scope of FIN 45 are formal product warranty
arrangements the Company has with its customers and indemnification provisions
that exist in certain of the Companys software license agreements.
 
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue
No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements
that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or
rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 will apply to
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. While the Company will continue to evaluate the
requirements of EITF Issue No. 00-21, management does not currently
believe adoption of the standard as written will have a significant impact on
its accounting for multiple element arrangements. However, the EITF has
recently indicated it is considering clarifying/changing how the scope
provisions of EITF 00-21 and SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition are to be
applied in determining which standard applies to multiple element transactions
involving both software and non-software components. The Company applies the
requirements of SOP No. 97-2 when accounting for such multiple element
transactions. The Company will assess the impact, if any, of changes to the
scope provisions of either standard when and if such changes occur.

As
of June 28, 2003, the Company had $4.545 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $208 million over
the same balances at the end of fiscal 2002. The principal components of this
increase were ­cash generated by operating activities of $216 million,
proceeds of $36 million from the sales of non-current investments, and proceeds
of $31 million from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by capital
expenditures of $106 million.
 
The Company believes its
existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be
sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock
repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements
associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.
 
Lease
Commitments
As of September 28, 2002, the Company had total outstanding commitments
on noncancelable operating leases of $464 million, $209 million of which
related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on
the Companys existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Total
outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases related to the lease
of retail space and related facilities rose to $304 million as of June 28,
2003.
 
37







 
Debt
The Company currently has debt outstanding in the form of
$300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes that was
originally issued in 1994. The notes, which pay interest semiannually, were
sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes,
along with approximately $7 million of unamortized deferred gains on closed
interest rate swaps, are due in February of 2004 and therefore have been
classified as current debt as of June 28, 2003. The Company currently
anticipates utilizing its existing cash balances to settle these notes when
due.
 
Purchase
Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers
The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture
sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and
test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and
build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which
typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains
individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders
based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically
cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for
periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The nature of the Companys outstanding
third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments has
not changed significantly since the end of its fiscal 2002.
 
Capital
Expenditures
The Companys total capital expenditures were $106 million during the
first nine months of fiscal 2003, $60 million of which were for retail store
facilities and equipment related to the Companys Retail segment and $46
million of which were for corporate infrastructure, including information
systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize
approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2003, approximately
$85 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the
Companys Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal
replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information
technology infrastructure.
 
Stock Repurchase Plan
In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a plan for
the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock.  This repurchase plan does not obligate the
Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any
specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan through
the end of fiscal 2000, the Company had repurchased a total of 5.05 million
shares at a cost of $191 million. No shares have been repurchased since the end
of fiscal 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a
forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in
September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of
$25.5 million.
 
Non-Current
Debt and Equity Investments
The Company has held significant investments in ARM, Akamai, and EarthLink. These investments have been
reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity
investments and categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported
in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All
realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other
income. With the exception of approximately 2.9 million shares of Akamai common
stock, all such investments have been sold prior to June 28, 2003. The fair
value of the Companys remaining investment in Akamai as of June 28, 2003, was
approximately $14 million. The Company believes it is likely there will
continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair value of this investment in
the future.
 
Additional information related to the Companys
non-current debt and equity investments may be found in this Form 10-Q in
the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 2, Financial
Instruments, and in the 2002 Form 10-K.

Factors That May Affect Future
Results and Financial Condition
 
Because of the following
factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys operating results and
financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be
a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
 
General economic conditions and
current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the Company.
The
Companys operating performance depends significantly on general economic
conditions. For much of the past 3 years, demand for the Companys products has
been negatively impacted by worsening global economic conditions. Additionally,
some of the Companys education customers appear to be delaying technology
purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on
their available funding. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions
continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should
global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate,
demand for the Companys products could continue to be adversely affected, as
could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.
 
The
terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, disrupted commerce
throughout the world and created many economic and political uncertainties that
have had a strong negative impact on the global economy. The long-term
effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Companys future operating
results and financial condition remain unknown. The national and international
responses to terrorist attacks, the potential for future terrorist attacks and
other acts of hostility, and the potential for further war in the Middle East
and elsewhere have created economic and political uncertainties that could
adversely affect the Companys future operating results and financial
condition.
 
Expansion and/or intensification of the outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and elsewhere could negatively affect
the Companys operations and performance.
The SARS outbreak has so
far had only a minor effect on the Company. The Company temporarily restricted
nonessential employee travel to various areas impacted by the illness during
parts of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2003 and formed an internal
management committee to closely monitor the situation. The Company experienced
weakness in net sales in specific areas affected by the illness and experienced
some increase in freight costs as airlines reduced service to certain areas. To
date, these conditions have not had a material adverse impact on the Companys
financial results or general operations. However, should the illness recur,
spread to new regions in Asia or elsewhere, or intensify in areas already
affected, the Companys operating results could be adversely impacted.
 
The Company and some of
its manufacturing vendors and component suppliers have significant operations
in various locations throughout Asia, including locations in mainland China,
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, all of which have
been subject to World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention SARS travel advisories at times during the second and third quarters
of fiscal 2003. Similar travel advisories were issued for Taiwan, where
substantially all of the Companys portable Macintosh systems and the iPod are
assembled. Should the illness spread further or should it intensify in regions
already affected, circumstances could arise that would negatively impact the
Company including the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions,
additional limitations in the availability of freight services within Asia and
between Asia and other regions, governmental actions limiting the movement of
products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,
and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and
component suppliers.
 
The
market for personal computers is highly competitive. If the Company is unable
to effectively compete in this market, its results of operations could be
adversely affected.
The personal
computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive
pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of
new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product
price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers,
and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price
competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense.
The Companys competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or
maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing
products that began in the second half of calendar 2000. The Companys results
of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue
to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures
and downward pressures on gross margins.
 
39







 
The personal
computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances
in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing
or emerging industry standards. 
Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more
reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are
smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market
share with the Companys existing products. 
Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced
their intention to target certain of the Companys key market segments,
including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing,
and design and publishing. 
Additionally, several of the Companys competitors have introduced or
announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design,
technical features, and solutions of the Companys products. The Company has
many substantial competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing,
manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines
and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally,
there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry
that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the
Companys markets.
 
The Company is
currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a
minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by
makers of computers utilizing Microsofts Windows operating systems. The
Companys future operating results and financial condition are substantially
dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh
platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over
competing platforms, including Windows.
 
The
Company has higher research and development and selling, general and
administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues, than many of its
competitors.
The Companys ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive
gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and
timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technology to the
marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development
costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell Windows-based
personal computers. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price
and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of
the Companys Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Companys
brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling
costs as a percent of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is
unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive
gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected
by its operating cost structure.
 
The
Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and
transitions.
Due to the highly
volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by
dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company
must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing
products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance,
the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the availability of application software for new products, the effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the
availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand,
and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance
the effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. This
includes the Companys planned introduction of Mac OS X version 10.3 Panther
and introduction of Power Mac G5 systems planned for the second half of
calendar 2003.
 
During 2001, the
Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its
first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. During 2002, the Company delivered
another major upgrade, Mac OS X Jaguar. As previously noted, the Company also
plans to introduce another major upgrade during the second half of calendar
2003. Inability of the Company to improve the performance and functionality of
Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its
upgrades, or obtain the continued commitment of software developers to
transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X or create new applications
to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating
results and financial condition.
 
Because orders for components, and
in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer
orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.
The Company
records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have
become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value
and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories
that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and
related provisions are
 
40







 
adequate, given
the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer
industry, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional
inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may
again have, a material effect on the Companys financial position and results
of operations.
 
The Company must order components for its products and build inventory
in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys markets are volatile and
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will
forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or
insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry
practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase
orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand
information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted
component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130
days. The Companys operating results and financial condition have been in the
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Companys
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts
in customer demand patterns.
 
Future
operating results are dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain a
sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available
only from limited sources.
Although most components essential to the Companys business are
generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including
microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key
components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and
optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company
from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and
pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often
initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the
Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies,
additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the
suppliers yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal
computer industry also compete for various components with other industries
that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer
industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of
these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on
the production of components other than those customized to meet the Companys
requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or
constrained on a new or existing product, including rights to music titles sold
on the iTunes Music Store, the Companys results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.
 
The Companys
ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the
ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC
RISC-based microprocessor for the Companys Macintosh computers, to provide the
Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance
features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Companys competitors
by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used
by personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Further, despite its
efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that
many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz
rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh
systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by Windows-based systems and
translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in
recent years where the inability of the Companys suppliers to provide advanced
PowerPC G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient
quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Companys results of
operations. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain
microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance
features could have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations
and financial condition.
 
The Company is dependent on
manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom
are located outside of the United States.
Many of the
Companys products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party
manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its
transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may
lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Companys direct
control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such
diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market
conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least
initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service or in the event of
product defects.  Any unanticipated
 
41







 
product defect or
warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers
or otherwise, could adversely affect the Companys future operating results and
financial condition.
 
Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the
Companys manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland,
and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan,
Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently,
manufacture of many of the components used in the Companys products and final
assembly of substantially all of the Companys portable products including
PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan.
If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is
disrupted by regional economic, business, environmental, medical, political, or
military conditions or events, the Companys results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
The
Companys products could experience quality problems that result in decreased
net sales and operating profits.
The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that
may contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system
software and applications such as the Company sells often contains bugs that
can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also
occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties that
may be beyond its control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells.
Failure to do so could result in lost revenues, loss of reputation, and
significant expense to remedy.
 
The Companys retail initiative
requires a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties.
Through
June 2003, the Company has opened 59 retail stores in the United States and
anticipates opening more stores during the remainder of calendar 2003. The
Companys retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment
and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The
Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for
retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 14 years. The Company could
incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close
individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of
operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion
of the Retail segments costs are fixed because of depreciation on store
construction costs and lease expense. As a result, should the Retail segment
experience a decline in sales for any reason, significant losses would result.
 
Certain
of the Companys stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile
venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing,
corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements,
locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the
Companys more typical retail stores. The Company has opened three such stores
and has others under development. Because of their location and size, these
high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger
operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical
stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years
with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25
million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high
profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial condition.
 
Many of the general risks
and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its
Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which
are beyond the Companys control, that could adversely affect the Retail
segments future results, cause its actual results to differ from those
currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail
operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include,
among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on
general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store
construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Companys retail
approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to
sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to
manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience
in managing retail operations; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations
in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability
to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost.

Unit sales of the Companys professionally oriented desktop
systems have declined sharply over past two to three years negatively impacting
net sales and gross margin.
Unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to
2001 and fell 35% in 2001 from 2000. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as
a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 38% in 1999 to 25% in 2002 and
20% during the first nine months of fiscal 2003. The Company believes that weak
economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced
negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary
users of such systems. The Company also believes that many of these customers
continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the
Companys ongoing transition to Mac OS X and in anticipation of certain
software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software
applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Also, it is likely that many
of the Companys current and potential customers, particularly professional and creative customers who are most
likely to utilize the Companys Power Macintosh systems, believe that
the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it
utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by
Windows-based systems and translates to slower overall system performance. In addition to the negative impact on net sales,
declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the
Companys overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems generally have
higher individual gross margins than the Companys other Macintosh systems.
Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales will adversely
affect the Companys future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of
Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover, it will be
difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. While the Company has announced plans to introduce
faster Power Macintosh systems utilizing 64-bit PowerPC G5 processors, there
can be no assurance that introduction of such systems will favorably impact net
sales either in the short or long term.
 
The
Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market.
Sales in the
United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college
and university customers, remain a core market for Apple. Net sales in these
markets fell to 21% of the Companys total net sales in 2002 from 26% in 2001.
The drop in 2002 reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales
in these markets of 15% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001.
Additionally, the Company experienced a 3% decline in net sales in its U.S.
education channel during the first nine months of 2003 as compared to the same
period in 2002. Industry data shows that the Company lost market share in the
U.S. education market in both fiscal 2002 and 2001. While the Company
experienced unit sales growth of 5% in its U.S. education channel during the
third quarter of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002, which may indicate
the Company has regained some market share during the quarter, total unit sales
in U.S. education did decline by 2% during the first nine months of 2003
compared to the same period in 2002. Several competitors of the Company have
either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for
personal computers. Although the Company has taken certain steps to strengthen
its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain
its existing share of that market. Failure to increase or maintain market share
in the education market may have an adverse impact on the Companys operating
results and financial condition.
 
The
Companys future operating performance is dependent on the performance of
distributors and other resellers of the Companys products.
The Company
distributes its products through a variety of resellers including wholesalers,
national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of who distribute
products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many
of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major
markets directly to end-users, certain education customers, and certain
resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells
its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores in
the United States. Many of the Companys significant resellers operate on
narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic
conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral
or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel
partners. The Companys business and financial results could be adversely
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers
within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Companys products,
or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products caused resellers
to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products.
 
Over the past
several years, an increasing proportion of the Companys net sales have been
made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the
world and through its retail stores in the United States. The Companys
resellers may perceive this expansion of the Companys direct sales as
conflicting with their own business and economic interests as distributors and
resellers of the Companys products. Perception of such a conflict could
discourage the Companys resellers from investing additional resources in the
distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease
distribution of the Companys products. The Companys
 
43







 
business and
financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales
to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution
of the Companys products.
 
The Companys business is subject to
the risks of international operations.
A large portion of
the Companys revenue is derived from its international operations. As a
result, the Companys operating results and financial condition could be
significantly affected by risks associated with international activities,
including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws
(including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods
and services are purchased. The Companys primary exposure to movements in
foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-dollar denominated sales in
Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar
denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in
foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely
impact consumer demand for the Companys products and the U.S. dollar value of
the Companys foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in
these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of
product components, negatively affecting the Companys results of operations.
 
Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales
of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be
adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by
international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.
 
Further
information related to the Companys global market risks may be found in Part
I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q under the subheading Foreign Currency Risk, and
also in the 2002 Form 10-K.
 
The Companys future performance is
dependent upon support from third-party software developers.
The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the
Companys personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems or
other devices, are often based on the availability of third-party
software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also
believes the availability of third-party application software for the
Companys hardware products depends in part on third-party developers
perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining,
and upgrading such software for the Companys products versus software for the
larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived
strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue
that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of
developing such software products. To the extent the Companys financial losses
in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the
personal computer market, as well as the Companys decision to end its Mac OS
licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Companys
prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to
develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Companys
products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and
upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, there can be no
assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X,
the Companys new operating system, on a timely basis or at all.
 
In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own
software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of
software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive
software for the Companys products. The Company currently markets and sells a
variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and
education customers that could influence the decision of third-party software
developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products.
Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for
professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual
effects for large format film and video productions, professional music
production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding
and authoring, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management,
digital music management, desktop-based database management, and high-quality
presentations, The Company also markets an integrated productivity application
that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation,
spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application.
 
In
August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent
cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five
years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the
number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to
make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the
Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer
for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its
products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship
with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial
 
44







 
to the Company and
to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does
compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly,
Microsofts interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following
expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsofts perception of its
interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of
Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would
have an adverse effect on the Companys net sales and results of operations. In
June of 2003, Microsoft stated that it would no longer develop new versions of
Internet Explorer for the Mac OS. Microsofts decision to discontinue
development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X appears to have been influenced
in part by the Companys introduction during 2003 of its own web browser,
Safari. It is unclear what impact, if any, Microsofts decision to cease
further development of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X will have on the Company.
However, if customers chose not to purchase the Companys products because
Internet Explorer is not available on the Macintosh platform or should websites
fail to provide support for web browsers other than Internet Explorer, the
Companys net sales and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.
 
The Companys business relies on
access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and
the Companys future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or
found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.
Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual
property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future
to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and
business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and
industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary
licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.
 
Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current
extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is
possible certain components of the Companys products and business methods may
unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to
time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless
of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and
cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending
claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the
desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.
However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on
acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a
temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from
marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of
infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a
third-party, the Companys future operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and potential
litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and
other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of the 2002 Form 10-K.  In the opinion of management, the Company
does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current
legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other
intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse
affect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the
results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should
the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of
patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I,
Item 3 of the 2002 Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved
against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
 
The Company expects its quarterly
revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons.
The Companys profit
margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. As a result, the
overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part,
on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that periods net
sales.
 
The typical concentration of net
sales in the third month of the Companys fiscal quarters can adversely affect
the Companys business and operating results.
The Company generally
sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during
either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer
industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Companys internal
infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the
Companys ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments
late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys
products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Companys key
logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the
Company and its results of operations and financial condition.
 
45







 
The Companys success depends
largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.
Much of the future
success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,
where the majority of the Companys employees are located. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract and retain the
key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive
performance in the Companys stock price may adversely affect its ability to
retain key employees.
 
The
Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of
insurance.
The Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance
markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such
conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles,
and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability,
the Company does not have insurance coverage. 
For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its
insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost.
 
The
Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable. This risk is
heightened as economic conditions worsen.
The Company distributes its products through third-party computer
resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and
commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade
receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also
has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting
from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the
Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit
exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no
assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk
and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies
fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the
Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening
financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.
 
The market value of the Companys
non-current debt and equity investments is subject to significant volatility.
The Company has
held minority investments in several public companies. As of June 28, 2003, the
Company continued to hold an investment in Akamai Technologies, Inc. with a
fair market value of approximately $14 million. Akamai Technologies, Inc. is a
publicly traded company whose share price is subject to significant volatility.
The Company has categorized its investment in Akamai as available-for-sale
requiring it be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The
Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current
debt and equity investments twice in the last two fiscal years.
 
The
Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations.
Production and
marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company
to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the
requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return
product to the Company at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility
for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the
Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on
the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance
that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company.
 
The parliament of the European Union has finalized the Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes
producers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially
responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future
products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual
European Union governments by August 13, 2004, while the producers financial
obligations are scheduled to start August 13, 2005. The Companys potential
liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products
and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial.
However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement
policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it
is not currently possible to estimate the Companys existing liability or
future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its
individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with
respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential
financial
 
46







 
impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies,
including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative
impact of which could be significant.
 
Business interruptions could
adversely affect the Companys future operating results.
The Companys
major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire,
power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes,
medical conditions, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the
Companys research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and
other critical business operations, including certain major components
suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The
Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses.
The Companys operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or
manmade disaster.
 
Unanticipated
changes in the Companys tax rates could affect its future results.
The Companys future effective tax rates could be favorably or
unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in
countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the
Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or
their interpretation.
 
The Companys stock price may be
volatile.
The Companys stock has at times experienced substantial price
volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial
results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In
addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies
in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these
companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions
and investors concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial
reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect
the market price of the Companys common stock in the future.
 
For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Companys
future results and financial condition, see Item 7, Managements Discussion
and Analysis - Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
and Item 1, Business in the Companys 2002 Form 10-K.
 
47







 
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk
The Companys market risk profile has not changed significantly from
that described in the 2002 Form 10-K.
 
Interest Rate and Foreign Currency
Risk Management
To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys foreign
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and
opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company regularly reviews its
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and
option positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,
from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the
effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged, there can be no
assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign
exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market
instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may
adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial position. The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), as of October
1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Management
does not believe that ongoing application of SFAS No. 133 will significantly
alter the Companys hedging strategies. 
However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and
expense and other comprehensive income.
 
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company
is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading
industrialized countries, the Companys interest income and expense is most
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this
regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the
Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as
costs associated with foreign currency hedges.
 
The Companys fixed income investment policy and strategy is to ensure
the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return
in light of the current credit and interest rate environment. The Company
benchmarks its performance by utilizing external money managers to manage a
small portion of the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers
adhere to the Companys investment policies and also provide occasional
research and market information that supplements internal research used to make
credit decisions in the investment process.
 
During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal
amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC.
The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of
6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15,
2004.
 
The Companys
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Companys investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations and related
derivative financial instruments. The Company places its short-term investments
in highly liquid securities issued by high credit quality issuers and, by
policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Companys
general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of
invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less are classified as cash
equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three
months are classified as short-term investments. As of June 28, 2003,
$338 million of the Companys investment portfolio that was classified as
short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of
September 28, 2002, $1.087 billion of the Companys investment portfolio that
was classified as short-term investments had maturities ranging from 1 to 5
years. The remainder of such short-term investments had underlying maturities
of between 3 and 12 months. Due to liquidity needs, or in anticipation of
credit deterioration, or for the purpose of duration management of the
Companys investment portfolio, the Company may sell investments prior to their
stated maturities.  As a result of such
activity, the Company recognized net gains of $3 million and $21 million during
the three and nine month periods ended June 28, 2003, respectively.
 
The Company sometimes enters into interest rate
derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors,
with financial institutions in order to better match the Companys
floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term
investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or
to diversify a
 
48







 
portion of the Companys exposure away from
fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into
interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest
rate risk management program.  The
Company entered into no interest rate asset swaps during 2002 or for the first
nine months of 2003 and had no open interest rate asset swaps at June 28, 2003.
 
During the last two
years, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial
institutions in order to better match the Companys floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of
the Companys exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest
rates. The interest rate swaps, which qualified as accounting hedges, generally
required the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or
six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without
exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. 
These swaps effectively converted the Companys fixed-rate 10-year debt
to floating-rate debt and converted a portion of the floating rate investments
to fixed rate. Due to prevailing market interest rates, during 2002 the Company
entered into and then subsequently closed out debt swap positions realizing a
gain of $6 million. During 2001 the Company closed out all of its then existing
debt swap positions realizing a gain of $17 million. Both the gains in 2002 and
2001 were deferred, recognized in long-term debt and are being amortized to
other income and expense over the remaining life of the debt. At certain times
in the past, the Company has also entered into interest rate contracts that are
intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The
Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes
other than risk management.
 
Foreign
Currency Risk
Overall, the
Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as
such, generally benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a
stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in
U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local
currency product pricing within the time frame of our hedged positions due to competitive
pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency
exchange rates.
 
The Company enters
into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions
primarily to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing
assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but
not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Companys practice is to
hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures.
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction
exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. The
Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of
certain recorded assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies of its foreign subsidiaries.
 
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Based on an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms.
 
There were no
significant changes in the Companys internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
identified, and therefore there were no corrective resulting actions taken.
However, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there is no certainty
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goal under all potential
future considerations.

PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
 
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
discussed below and/or in the 2002 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to
certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any
current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. However, the
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the
Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of
these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be
materially adversely affected.
 
Pitney
Bowes Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc.
Plaintiff Pitney Bowes filed this patent infringement action on June
18, 2001 alleging patent infringement relating to laser printer technology.
Plaintiff filed similar lawsuits against other companies. Plaintiff sought
unspecified damages and other relief. 
The Company answered the complaint, denying all allegations and
asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The Company settled this matter during
the second quarter of 2003 for an amount that did not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 
Hawaii
Structural Iron Workers and Pension Trust Fund v. Apple Computer, Inc. and
Steven P. Jobs; Young v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al; Hsu v. Apple Computer Inc.
et al
Beginning on September 27, 2001, three shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer.
These lawsuits are substantially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf
of persons who purchased the Companys publicly traded common stock between
July 19, 2000, and September 28, 2000. The complaints allege violations of the
1934 Securities Exchange Act and seek unspecified compensatory damages and
other relief. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends
to defend them vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on June 4,
2002, which was heard by the Court on September 13, 2002. On December 11, 2002,
the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause
of action, with leave to plaintiffs to amend their complaint. Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint on January 31, 2003, and on March 17, 2003, the Company
filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. A hearing on the Companys
motion was held on July 11, 2003, and the Court has yet to issue a ruling on
the matter.

Administrator at the time of grant. Stock appreciation rights (SARs) may be
granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of Options.
Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

to the administration of stock option plans under U.S. state corporate laws,
U.S. federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or

result in termination of the employment relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary, as the case may be, under the terms of the respective Company
policy for such leave; however, vesting may be tolled while an employee
is on an approved leave of absence under the terms of the respective Company
policy for such leave; or (ii) in the case
of transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or its successor. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options,
no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless reemployment upon expiration of
such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon
expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed,
on the 91st day of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the
Optionee shall cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and shall be
treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. Neither service as a
Chairman nor as a Director nor payment of a directors fee by the Company shall
be sufficient to constitute employment by the Company.

Market, its Fair Market Value shall be the closing sales price for such stock
(or the closing bid, if no sales were reported) as quoted on such exchange or
system, on the date of determination or, if the date of determination is not a
trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems
reliable;
 
(ii)                                  If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a
recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, the Fair
Market Value of a Share of Common Stock shall be the mean between the high bid
and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of determination or, if
there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, on the last day on
which there are quoted prices prior to the date of determination, as reported
in The
Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems
reliable; or
 
(iii)                               In the absence of an established market for the Common Stock, the Fair
Market Value shall be determined in good faith by the Administrator.

3.                                       Stock Subject
To The Plan.  Subject
to the provisions of Section 15 of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of
Shares which may be optioned and sold under the Plan or for which SARs or Stock
Purchase Rights may be granted and exercised is 48,000,000 Shares. The Shares
may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.
 
In
the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares authorized under
the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.
 
If
an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right issued under the Plan should expire or
become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full, the
unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall become available for other
Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights under this Plan (unless the Plan has
terminated); however, should the Company reacquire Shares which were issued
pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR, such Shares shall not become
available for future grant under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock are
repurchased by the Company at their original purchase price, such shares
 
5







 
shall
become available for future grant under the Plan.
 
4.                                       Administration
of the Plan.
 
(a)                                  Procedure.
 
(i)                                     Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If
permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor
rule thereto, as in effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with
respect to the Plan, and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws
relating to the administration of stock plans such as the Plan, if any, the
Plan may (but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies with
respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are
Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are neither
Directors nor Officers.
 
(ii)                                  Section 162(m).  To the
extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Options
or SARs granted hereunder as performance-based compensation within the
meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a
Committee of two or more outside directors within the meaning of Section 162(m)
of the Code.
 
(iii)                               Rule 16b-3.  To the
extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3,
the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the
requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.
 
(iv)                              Other Administration.  Other
than as provided above, the Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B)
a Committee, which committee shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.
 
(b)                                 Powers of the Administrator.  Subject
to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the
specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator
shall have the authority, in its discretion:
 
(i)                                     to determine the Fair Market Value;
 
(ii)                                  to
select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights may be
granted hereunder;
 
6







 
(iii)                               to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;
 
(iv)                              to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
 
(v)                                 to determine the terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited
to, the exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs
or Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on performance
criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and
any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such
factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
 
7







 
(vi)                              to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall have declined
since the date the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right was granted; however,
the Administrator may not reprice options, including 6-months-plus-1-day
option exchange programs, without shareholder approval.
 
(vii)                           to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards granted pursuant
to the Plan;
 
(viii)                        to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the
Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the
purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax laws;
 
(ix)                                to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right (subject to
Section 17(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the
post-termination exercisability period of Options longer than is otherwise
provided for in the Plan;
 
(x)                                   to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax
obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued upon exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld.  The Fair Market Value of the
Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to
be withheld is to be determined. All elections by an Optionee to have Shares
withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions
as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
 
(xi)                                to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any
instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right previously granted by the Administrator; and
 
(xii)                             to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for
administering the Plan.
 
(c)                                  Effect of Administrators Decision.  The
Administrators decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final
and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock
Purchase Rights.
 
5.                                       Eligibility.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock
Purchase Rights may be granted to Employees and the Chairman or to such other
individuals as 
 
8







 
determined
by the Administrator whom the Company has offered a position of Chairman or
Employee. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.
 
9







 
6.                                       Limitations.
 
(a)                                  Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement
as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market
Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under
all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such
Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this
Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order
in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be
determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(b)                                 Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock
Purchase Right shall confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to
continuing the Optionees relationship as an Employee with or Chairman of the
Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Optionees right or the
Companys right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without
cause.
 
(c)                                  The following limitations shall apply to grants
of Options and SARs:
 
(i)                                     No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal
year of the Company, Options or SARs to purchase more than 34,000,000 Shares;
 
(ii)                                  The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted
proportionately in connection with any change in the Companys capitalization
as described in Section 15;
 
(iii)                               If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the Company in
which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in
Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted against the limits set forth
in subsections (i) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option
or SAR is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the
Option or SAR and the grant of a new Option or SAR.
 
7.                                       Term of Plan.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan
shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in
effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16
of the Plan.
 
8.                                       Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be stated in
the Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten
(10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in
the
 
10







 
Agreement.
Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who,
at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more
than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
 
11







 
all
classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the
Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such
shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement.
 
9.                                       Option
Exercise Price and Consideration.
 
(a)                                  Exercise Price.  The per share exercise price for the Shares
to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
Administrator, subject to the following:
 
(i)                                     In the case of an Incentive Stock Option;
 
(A)                              granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is
granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting
power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the
per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value
per Share on the date of grant; or
 
(B)                                granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A)
immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of
the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant;
 
(ii)                                  In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the
per Share exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case
of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as performance-based
compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share
exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant;
 
(iii)                               Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share
exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date
of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a merger or other
corporate transaction.
 
(b)                                 Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.  At the
time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which
the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be
satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
 
12







 
(c)                                  Form of Consideration.  The Administrator shall
determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option,
including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time
of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:
 
(i)                                     cash;
 
(ii)                                  check;
 
(iii)                               promissory note;
 
(iv)                              other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an
option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of
surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to
the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be
exercised;
 
(v)                                 consideration received by the Company under a
cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the
Plan;
 
(vi)                              a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Optionee,
including any liability attributable to the Optionees participation in any
Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
 
(vii)                           any combination of the foregoing methods of
payment; or
 
(viii)                        such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares
to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
 
10.                                 Stock
Appreciation Rights.
 
(a)                                  Granted in Connection with Options.  At the
sole discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with
all or any part of an Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option
or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option. The following
provisions apply to SARs that are granted in connection with Options:
 
(i)                                     The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise
the SAR by surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related
Option.  The Optionee shall receive in
exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market
Value on the date of exercise of
 
13







 
the
SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered
 
14







 
by
the surrendered portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise
of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict the
exercisability of the related Option;
 
(ii)                                  When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to
the extent surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;
 
(iii)                               A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the related
Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on which the
related Option expires; and
 
(iv)                              A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise price of the
Common Stock covered by the related Option.
 
(b)                                 Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options. The following
provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:
 
(i)                                     The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising
the SAR, to receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the
Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date on which the
SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator may place limits on
the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR; and
 
(ii)                                  SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part,
at such times as the Administrator shall specify in the Optionees Agreement.
 
(c)                                  Form of Payment. The Companys obligation arising upon the exercise of a SAR may be paid
in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination of Common Stock and cash, as
the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon
the exercise of a SAR shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date
of exercise.
 
(d)                                 Rule 16b-3.
SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional restrictions as may be
required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement in order for the SAR to
qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.
 
15







 
11.                                 Exercise of
Option or SAR.
 
(a)                                  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.  Any
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of
the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
Administrator and set forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised
for a fraction of a Share.
 
An
Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written
or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms of the Option or
SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR, and (ii) full
payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full
payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by
the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued
upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if
requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse.
Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books
of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right
to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist
with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the
Option is exercised.  No adjustment will
be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the
date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.
 
Exercising
an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter
available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the
number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is
exercised, result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall
be available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be
exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.
 
(b)                                 Termination of Continuous Status as Chairman.  Upon
termination of an Optionees Continuous Status as Chairman (other than
termination by reason of the Optionees death), the Optionee may, but only
within ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise his or her
Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of such
termination.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the
Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time
from the date of grant.
 
(c)                                  Termination of Continuous Employment.  Upon
termination of an Optionees Continuous Status as Employee (other than
termination by reason of
 
16







 
the
Optionees death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days after the
date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that
 
17







 
it
was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not
be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.
 
(d)                                 Death of Optionee.  If an Optionee dies (i) while
an Employee or Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionees
estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest
or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or (ii) within
ninety (90) days after the termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months
(or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by
the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionees estate or by a
person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued
at the date of termination. If the Option or SAR is not so exercised within the
time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares
covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.
 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date
the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of
time from the date of grant.
 
(e)                                  Buyout Provisions.  The Administrator may at any
time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR
previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator
shall establish and communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is
made.
 
12.                                 Stock Purchase
Rights.
 
(a)                                  Rights to Purchase.  Stock Purchase Rights may be
issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted
under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the
Administrator determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the
Plan, it shall advise the Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms,
conditions and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of
Shares that the Optionee shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid,
and the time within which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall
be accepted by execution of an
 
18







 
Agreement
in the form determined by the Administrator.
 
(b)                                 Repurchase Option.  Unless the Administrator
determines otherwise, the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option
exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchasers
service with the Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The
purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the
original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any
indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse
at a rate determined by the Administrator.
 
(c)                                  Other Provisions.  The Agreement shall contain
such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as
may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
 
(d)                                 Rights as a Shareholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right
is exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a
shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered
upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date
is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as provided
in Section 15 of the Plan.
 
13.                                 Transferability
of Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights.  Unless determined otherwise by the
Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right may not be sold, pledged,
assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by
will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title 1 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, and may be exercised, during the lifetime of
the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes an Option, SAR
or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems
appropriate.
 
14.                                 Stock
Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax Obligations.  When an Optionee incurs tax liability in
connection with the exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which
tax liability is subject to tax withholding under applicable tax laws, and the
Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an amount required to be withheld
under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax
obligation by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of
the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number of Shares having a Fair
Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value
of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of
tax to be withheld is to be determined (the Tax Date).
 
19







 
All elections by an
Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in writing in a
form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the following
restrictions: 
(a)                                  the
election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date; and
 
(b)                                 ll elections shall be subject to the consent or
disapproval of the Administrator.
 
In the event the election
to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred
under Section 83 of the Code because no election is filed under Section 83(b)
of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full number of Shares with respect
to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right is exercised but such Optionee
shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the proper
number of Shares on the Tax Date.
 
15.                                 Adjustments
Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or Asset Sale.
 
(a)                                  Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action
by the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock
covered by each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number
of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the
Plan but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration
of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of
Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the
number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of
Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company;
provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company
shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration.
Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect
shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no
issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares
of Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.
 
(b)                                 Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company,
all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights will terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such
 
20







 
proposed
action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The Administrator may,
in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as of a date fixed by the
Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option,
SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the Optioned Stock,
including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right would not
otherwise be exercisable.
 
(c)                                  Merger or Asset Sale.  Unless
otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event of a merger of the
Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the
assets of the Company, each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right
shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor
corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the
event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have
the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the
Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested
or exercisable. If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested
and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger
or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in writing or
electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully
vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such
notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the
expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option, SAR
or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or
sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or receive,
for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration
(whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the
merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the
effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received
in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the
successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the
exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share of Optioned
Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, to be solely common
stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to
the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger
or sale of assets.
 
(d)                                 Change in Control.  In the event of a Change in
Control of the Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise
determined by
 
21







 
the
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:
 
(i)                                     Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
outstanding as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have
occurred that are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become
fully exercisable and vested; and
 
(ii)                                  The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and
Stock Purchase Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator
at or after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options, SARs and
Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x)
the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price of
the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right. The
cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the event of death of an
Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the Optionee or to a person who
acquired the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest
or inheritance.
 
(e)                                  Definition of Change in Control.  For purposes of this Section 15, a Change
in Control means the happening of any of the following:
 
(i)                                     When any person, as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a
Subsidiary or a Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such
plan acting as trustee) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power
of the Companys then outstanding securities; or
 
(ii)                                  The occurrence of a transaction requiring
shareholder approval, and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another
corporation.
 
(f)                                    Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this Section
15, Change in Control Price shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i)
the highest Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately
preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
Administrator (the 60-Day Period), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered,
as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide
offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within the
60-Day Period.
 
22







 
16.                                 Date of Grant.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock
Purchase Right shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator
makes the determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or
such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the
determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after
the date of such grant.
 
17.                                 Amendment and
Termination of the Plan.
 
(a)                                  Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at any time
amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
 
(b)                                 Shareholder Approval.  The Company shall obtain
shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and
desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
 
(c)                                  Effect of Amendment or Termination.  No
amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the
rights of any Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee
and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the
Optionee and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the
Administrators ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with
respect to Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights granted under the Plan prior
to the date of such termination.
 
18.                                 Conditions
Upon Issuance of Shares.
 
(a)                                  Legal Compliance.  Shares shall not be issued
pursuant to the exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the
exercise of such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and
delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further
subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.
 
(b)                                 Investment Representations.  As a condition to the exercise
of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person
exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant at
the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for
investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares
if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is
required.
 
19.                                 Inability to
Obtain Authority.  The
inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having
jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be
necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall
relieve the Company of any liability in
 
23







 
respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite
authority shall not have been obtained.
 
20.                                 Reservation of
Shares.  The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
 
21.                                 Shareholder
Approval.  The Plan
shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve
(12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such shareholder approval shall
be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
 
22.                                 Non-U.S.
Employees.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the United
States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan
in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to meet
the objectives of the Plan.  The
Committee may, where appropriate, establish one or more sub-plans for this
purpose.

Agreement is made March 19, 2003 (the Effective Date), by and between

October 19, 2001 (collectively, the Options) pursuant to Apples 1998
Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan).
 
Mr. Jobs and Apple both desire to cancel the Options
in their entirety and Apple desires to grant Mr. Jobs a restricted stock award
of 5,000,000 shares of Apple common stock.
 
Mr. Jobs and Apple agree as follows:
 
1.                                       Cancellation
of Options.  The Options shall be
cancelled and disposed of to Apple as of the Effective Date. Following such
cancellation, Mr. Jobs shall have no rights whatsoever with respect to the
Options.
 
2.                                       Grant
of Restricted Stock.  Apple hereby grants
to Mr. Jobs as of the Effective Date, a restricted stock award of 5,000,000
shares of Apple common stock (the Shares) pursuant to the terms and
conditions contained herein and the terms and conditions of the 1998 Plan.
 
3.                                       Vesting of the Shares.
 
(a)                                  Release Date. 
One hundred percent (100%) of the Shares shall be vested on
March 19, 2006 (the Release Date) provided that Mr. Jobs has remained
continuously employed by Apple, or any parent or subsidiary of Apple, until such
date.
 
(b)                                 Termination Without Cause Prior to
Release Date.  In the event of termination by Apple of Mr.
Jobs employment without Cause (as defined below) prior to the Release Date,
the Shares shall be fully vested in Mr. Jobs as of such termination date.
 
(c)                                  Termination Due to Death. 
In the event of termination of employment due to Mr. Jobs death prior

Reacquisition Right described below. 
The unvested Shares shall remain subject to the Reacquisition Right.
 







 
(d)                                 Resignation for Good Reason Following a
Change in Control.  In the event there is a Change in Control
of Apple (as defined in Section 15(d) of the 1998 Plan) and as a consequence of
such Change in Control, Mr. Jobs resigns for Good Reason (as defined below),
the following acceleration provisions shall apply:
 
(i)                               If such Change of Control and subsequent
resignation for Good Reason occurs during the first eighteen (18) months
following the Effective Date, then 50% of the Shares shall be immediately
vested in Mr. Jobs and shall be released from the Reacquisition Right.
 
(ii)                            If
such Change of Control and
subsequent resignation for Good Reason occurs more than eighteen (18) months
after the Effective Date, then 100% of the Shares shall be immediately vested
in Mr. Jobs and shall be released from the Reacquisition Right.
 
(e)                                  Termination for Other Reasons. 
In the event that Mr. Jobs employment with Apple, or any parent or
subsidiary of Apple, terminates prior to the Release Date for any reason other
than those specified in Sections (b), (c) and (d) above, including termination
voluntarily by Mr. Jobs or by Apple for Cause, Apple shall, upon the date of
such termination, have an irrevocable, exclusive option (the Reacquisition
Right) to reacquire the Shares at no cost to the Apple.
 
(f)                                    Exercise
of Reacquisition Right.  The
Reacquisition Right shall be exercised by Apple by delivering written notice to
Mr. Jobs or to Mr. Jobs executor within ninety (90) days following the date of
termination.  Upon delivery of such
notice, Apple shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Shares being
reacquired and all rights and interests therein, and Apple shall have the right
to retain and transfer to its own name the Shares being reacquired.
 
(g)                                 Termination
of Reacquisition Right.  If the
Company does not elect to exercise the Reacquisition Right conferred above by
giving the requisite notice within ninety (90) days following the termination
of Mr. Jobs employment by Apple, or any parent or subsidiary of Apple, the
Reacquisition Right shall terminate and the Shares shall be fully vested in Mr.
Jobs. The Shares released from the Reacquisition Right shall be delivered to
Mr. Jobs at his request.
 
(h)                                 Certain
Definitions.
 
(i)                                     Cause  For purposes of this Section 3, Cause
shall mean:  (i) a willful act of
embezzlement, fraud or dishonesty by Mr. Jobs which is materially injurious to
Apple; (ii) Mr. Jobs continued violation of his obligation to perform the
duties and responsibilities normally required of a chief executive officer
which are willful or grossly negligent, after Mr. Jobs has been given written
notice from the Apple Board of Directors describing his violations and has
failed to cure or commence to cure such violations within thirty (30) days; or
(iii) Mr. Jobs conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony which
the Board of 
 
2







 
Directors reasonably
believes has had or will have a material detrimental effect on Apples
reputation or business.
 
(ii)                                  Good
Reason. For purposes of this Section 3, Good Reason shall mean a resignation
by Mr. Jobs of his employment with Apple, or any parent or subsidiary of Apple,
as a result of any of the following:
 
(a)                                  A
meaningful and detrimental alteration of his position, his title, or the nature
or status of his responsibilities (including his reporting responsibilities)
from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.   For purposes of this clause (a), a
meaningful and detrimental alteration shall exist if, on or after the Change in
Control, Mr. Jobs does not hold the position of Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (or the surviving entity resulting from a merger or consolidation of
the Company with another entity (the Surviving Entity) or if there is any
adverse change on or after the Change in Control in his title, position or
reporting responsibilities;
 
(b)                                 A
reduction by Apple in Mr. Jobs annual base salary as in effect immediately
prior to the Change in Control or as the same may be increased from time to

4.                                       Restriction

the Release Date or any earlier lapse or termination of the Reacquisition
Right.
 
5.                                       Escrow
of Shares.  Until the Release Date,
the Shares will be held in book name by Apples transfer agent. Subject to the
terms hereof, Mr. Jobs shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect to
such Shares while they are held in escrow, including without limitation, the
right to vote the Shares and receive any cash dividends declared thereon.  If, from time to time during the term of the
Reacquisition Right, there is (i) any stock dividend, stock split or other
change in the Shares, or (ii) any merger or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets or other acquisition of Apple, any and all new, substituted or
additional securities to which Mr. Jobs is entitled by reason of his ownership
of the Shares shall be held on his behalf by the Apples transfer agent and
included thereafter as Shares for purposes of this Agreement and the
Reacquisition Right.
 
3







 
6.                                       Tax
Consequences.  Mr. Jobs understands
that he (and not Apple) shall be responsible for his own tax liability that may
arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Mr. Jobs understands that Section 83 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) taxes as ordinary income
the difference between the amount paid for the Shares and the fair market value
of the Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse.  In this context, restriction includes the
right of Apple to reacquire the Shares pursuant to its Reacquisition Right.  Mr. Jobs understands that he may elect to be
taxed at the time the Shares are granted rather than when the Reacquisition
Right lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the
I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of grant.
 
7.                                       General
Provisions.
 
(a)                                  This
Agreement and the 1998 Plan represent the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral.
 
(b)                                 This
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without
reference to its conflicts of law principles.
 
(c)                                  No
waiver, alteration or modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding, unless in writing and signed by duly authorized
representatives of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall be binding on, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.
 
(d)                                 This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
 
IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement effective as of the date
set forth above.
