PART I
 





Item 1.

 

Business.




 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms
refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its subsidiaries and their
respective operations.  Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks
ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year.  Fiscal
2003 included 53 weeks of operations.   All other fiscal years
presented included 52 weeks of operations.

Overview

We
primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles). We currently are the second
largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
items to "do-it-yourself," or DIY, and “do-it-for-me,” or DIFM, customers in the
United States, based on store count and sales.

We were
formed in 1929 as Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and operated as a
retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s. During the 1980s, we sharpened
our focus to target sales of automotive parts and accessories to DIY customers.
From the 1980s to the present, we have grown significantly as a result of strong
comparable store sales growth, new store openings and strategic acquisitions.
Since 1996, we have aggressively expanded our sales to DIFM customers through
our commercial delivery program. Our parent company, Advance Auto Parts, Inc.,
was incorporated in 2001 in conjunction with the acquisition of Discount Auto
Parts, Inc., or Discount. More recently in 2005, we acquired Autopart
International, Inc., or AI.

Our
Internet address is www.AdvanceAutoParts.com.
We make available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically
file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Operating
Segments

We
conduct our operations in two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts, or AAP,
and AI.  The AAP segment is comprised of our store operations within
the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which operate under the
trade names “Advance Auto Parts,” “Advance Discount Auto Parts” and “Western
Auto.” The AI segment consists solely of the operations of Autopart
International, which continues to operate as an independent, wholly-owned
subsidiary.

Financial
information on our segments is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is
available in Note 18, Segment and Related Information, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

AAP
Segment

At
December 29, 2007, we operated 3,153 stores within the United States, Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands. We operated 3,123 stores throughout 40 states in
the Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States.
These stores operated under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for
certain stores in the state of Florida, which operated under the “Advance
Discount Auto Parts” trade name. These stores offer a broad selection of brand
name and proprietary automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance
items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks. In addition, we operated
30 stores under the “Western Auto” and “Advance Auto Parts” trade names, located
in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or Offshore.

We also
provide our customers online shopping and access to over two million stock
keeping units, or SKUs.  Our online site allows our customers to pick
up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases

AAP
Stores

Store
Overview.   Our stores
generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle
traffic counts, good visibility and easy access to major roadways. We believe
that our stores exhibit a customer-friendly format with the majority of our
stores featuring an updated exterior and interior, brighter lighting, clean
graphics and a well-designed and easily navigated floor plan. The average size
of our stores is 7,400 square feet with the size of our new stores approximating
7,000 square feet. We have recently introduced a 6,000 square foot prototype
store. Our stores generally are open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week
and 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Sundays and most holidays to meet the needs of our
DIY and DIFM customers. We offer extended hours in a limited number of our
stores, including 24 hours per day in certain stores.

Our
stores carry a standard SKU offering of approximately 16,000 SKUs while certain
stores carry slightly more SKUs within centralized market locations where there
is demand for a more customized assortment of merchandise. Additionally, certain
of our stores serve as Local Area Warehouses, or LAWs, where they carry an
additional customized assortment of 10,000 SKUs for next day delivery to
selected stores within the service area of each respective LAW. The standard SKU
offering within each of our stores is replenished from one of our eight
distribution centers on an average of once per week.

We also
utilize a network of Parts Delivered Quickly, or PDQ®,
facilities and one Master PDQ® facility
to ensure our stores have the right product at the right time for our customers’
needs. Our PDQ® and
Master PDQ® network
of facilities provide our customers an additional assortment of approximately
80,000 less common parts and accessories on same-day or overnight basis. Lastly,
our customers have access to over 275,000 SKUs though our Special Order Center,
an in-store kiosk where they order the requested item directly from one of our
vendors for delivery to a particular store or other destination as chosen by the
customer.

Store
team members utilize our proprietary point-of-sale (“POS”) system, including a
fully integrated electronic parts catalog to identify and suggest the
appropriate quality and price options for the SKUs that we carry, as well as the
related products, tools or additional information that is required by our
customers to complete their automotive repair projects properly and
safely.  We strive to be the leader in the automotive aftermarket
industry in serving our customers by providing quality products at the right
price and backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service. We offer
many of the products in our stores at a good, better or best recommendation
differentiated by price and quality.

Some of
the products offered in our stores include the following:







Filters


Alternators


Transmissions


Windshield
      Wipers




Radiators


Batteries


Clutches

      Washer Fluid

      recycling



 

Our
retail stores are 100% company operated and are divided into four geographic
areas.  A senior vice president, who is supported by five to six
regional vice presidents, manages each area of retail
stores.  Division managers report to the regional vice presidents and
have direct responsibility for store operations in a specific division, which
typically consists of 13 to 16 stores.  Depending on store size and
sales volume, each store is staffed by eight to 14 team members under the
leadership of a store manager. We offer training to our employees, who we refer
to as team members, including formal classroom workshops, online seminars and
certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence
("ASE"), which is broadly recognized for training certification in
the

automotive
industry. We also continue to increase the number of bilingual team members in
our stores to better serve an increasingly diverse customer base.

Commercial
Sales.  In
addition to the in-store customer service provided to our DIY customers, we also
maintain a commercial sales team dedicated to the development of our commercial
business and the support of our DIFM customers, certain of which consist of
national and regional accounts.  Since 1996, we have aggressively
expanded our sales to DIFM customers through our commercial delivery program.
Sales to DIFM customers represented approximately 25% of our AAP sales in 2007
and consisted of sales to both walk-in commercial customers and sales delivered
to our commercial customers’ place of business, including independent garages,
service stations and auto dealers. Our commercial strategy consists of the
development of commercial marketing and merchandising initiatives with the
continued focus on getting our DIFM customers to use us as their “first call”
supplier. At December 29, 2007, we had 2,604 AAP stores with commercial delivery
programs, or 83% of total AAP stores, which was slightly up from 81% at December
30, 2006.

Store
Development. Our store development
program has historically focused on adding new stores within existing markets,
relocating and remodeling existing stores and entering new markets. The addition
of new stores, along with strategic acquisitions, has played a significant role
in our growth and success. We believe the addition of new stores will continue
to play a significant role in our future growth and success.

Our 3,153
AAP stores were located in the following states and territories at December 29,
2007:

Store Technology.
 Our
store-based information systems, which are designed to improve the efficiency of
our operations and enhance customer service, are comprised of a proprietary
point-of-sale, or POS, system and electronic parts catalog, or EPC,
system.  Information maintained by our POS system is used to formulate
pricing, marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory
accurately and rapidly. Our POS system is fully integrated with our EPC system
that enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts
selection and ordering based on year, make, model and engine type of their
vehicles. Our centrally based EPC data management system enables us to reduce
the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalog and
deliver updated, accurate product information.

Our EPC
system also contains enhanced search engines and user-friendly navigation tools
that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well as
additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair
project. If a hard-to-find part or accessory is not available at one of our
stores, the EPC system can determine whether the part is carried and in-stock
through our PDQÒ
system. Available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from
another store, LAW, PDQÒ
or Master PDQÒ
with immediate confirmation of price, availability and estimated delivery
time.

We also
support our store operations with additional proprietary systems. Our
store-level inventory management system provides real-time inventory tracking at
the store level. With the store-level system, store team members can check the
quantity of on-hand inventory for any SKU, adjust stock levels for select items
for store specific events, automatically process returns and defective
merchandise, designate SKUs for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers.
Our stores use radio frequency hand-held devices to help ensure the accuracy of
our inventory. Our standard operating procedure, or SOP, system is a web-based,
electronic data management system that allows our team members instant and quick
access to any of our standard operating procedures through a comprehensive
on-line search function.  Additionally, we utilize a labor scheduling
system known as management planning and training, or MPT. All of these systems
are tightly integrated and together provide real-time, comprehensive information
to store personnel, resulting in improved customer service levels, team member
productivity and in-stock availability.

Store
Support Center

Merchandising.
 Purchasing
for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our
centralized corporate offices in Roanoke, Virginia, or store support
center.  In 2007, we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors, with
no single vendor accounting for more than 7% of purchases. Our purchasing
strategy involves negotiating agreements with certain vendors to purchase
merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms, including
pricing, payment terms and volume.

Our
merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and
maintaining consistent inventory levels. The merchandising team has developed
strong vendor relationships in the industry and, in a collaborative effort with
our vendor partners, utilizes a category management process. We believe this
process, which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise
category, has been highly effective and is critical to improving comparable
store sales, gross margin and inventory turns.

Our
merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name
automotive parts and accessories such as Bosch®,
Castrol®,
Sylvania®,
Prestone®,
Monroe®,
Bendix®,
Purolator®,
Dayco® and
Trico®, which
generates DIY customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers. In
addition to these branded products, we stock a wide selection of high quality
proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers. These lines of
merchandise include everything from chemical and wash-and-wax products to tools,
batteries, parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of
Professional’s FavoriteTM, Joe’s
GarageTM,
Mechanic’s ChoiceTM, Auto
XpressTM,
AutocraftTM,
EnduranceTM,
WeareverTM,
JobmateTM and
MirageTM.

Supply
Chain.  Our
supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation
functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers, PDQ®
warehouses and stores. Our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment
system, or E-3, to monitor the distribution center, PDQ®
warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when
appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that
product. E-3 utilizes the most up-to-date information from our POS system as
well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history, sales trends by SKU,
seasonality and demographic shifts in demand. E-3

combines
these factors with service level goals, vendor lead times and cost of inventory
assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders. A significant
portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange, with
the remainder being sent by computer generated e-mail or facsimile.

Our
transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently
managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores. Benefits
from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs,
visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain, a
reduction in distribution center inventory, or safety stock, due to consistent
transit times, decreased third party freight and billing service costs,
decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store in-stock
position.

We
currently operate eight distribution centers. All of these distribution centers
are equipped with our distribution center management system, or
DCMS.  Our DCMS provides real-time inventory tracking through the
processes of receiving, picking, shipping and replenishing at our distribution
centers.  The DCMS, integrated with technologically advanced material
handling equipment, significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs,
while improving efficiency.  This equipment includes carousels,
“pick-to light” systems, robotic picking, radio frequency technology, voice
technology and automated sorting systems. Through the continued implementation
of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient
utilization of our distribution capacity. We believe our current capacity will
allow us to support in excess of 3,400 stores. During 2007, we announced our
plan to build a new distribution center in Indiana now scheduled to open in
early-2010.

We
currently offer approximately 58,000 SKUs to substantially support all of our
retail stores via our 13 stand-alone PDQ®
warehouses and/or our eight distribution centers (all of which stock PDQ® items).
Stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place
orders to these facilities, or as an alternative, through an online ordering
system to virtually any of the other facilities.  Ordered parts are
delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through
our dedicated PDQ® trucking
fleet and third party carriers. Store inventories are replenished from our eight
distribution centers. In addition, we operate a Master PDQ®
warehouse that stocks 45,000 incremental SKUs of harder-to-find automotive parts
and accessories and utilizes our existing PDQ®
distribution infrastructure and/or third party arrangements to provide next day
service to substantially all of our stores.

Advertising.
 We have an
extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings,
parts assortment and availability, competitive prices, free services and
commitment to customer service. The program is focused on establishing Advance
Auto Parts as the resource for a customer's automotive needs. We use a mix of
media that reinforces our brand image, including television, radio, promotional
signage, outdoor media, print and our Internet site.

Our
advertising plan is a brand-building program built around television and radio
advertising. The plan is supported by in-store signage, online advertising and
print. Our television advertising is a combination of national and regional
media in both sports and entertainment programming. Radio advertising generally
airs during peak drive times. We use Spanish-language radio and television
advertising to market to our Hispanic customers. Our advertising program is also
supported through sponsorships of sporting events, racing teams and other events
at all levels in a grass-roots effort to positively impact individual
communities, including Hispanic and other ethnic communities, to create
awareness and drive traffic for our stores.  Since 2004, we have used
an integrated consumer education program to build our image as not only the
source for parts, but also the best resource for vehicle information. Our goal
with this initiative is to continue our long-term brand building success,
increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base.

In
February 2008, we launched a new branding campaign, “Keep the Wheels Turning.”
This campaign was developed based on a strategic review of our business as well
as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members. We believe
this campaign, which targets both DIY and DIFM customers will differentiate
Advance Auto Parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand
name parts and products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to
help customers keep their vehicles running. The campaign includes creative and
compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an
enduring, positive image of Advance Auto Parts.

AI
Segment

We
acquired AI in September 2005. The acquisition, which included 61 stores
throughout New England and New York, a distribution center and AI’s wholesale
distribution business, complements our growing presence in the DIFM market in
the Northeast.

AI’s
business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations. In
addition, its North American Sales Division services warehouse distributors and
jobbers throughout North America. We believe AI provides a high level of service
to its commercial customers by providing quality parts, unsurpassed customer
service and efficient parts delivery. As a result of its extensive sourcing
network, AI is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for
both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on
imported parts. The vast majority of AI’s product is sold under its proprietary
brand. The AI stores offer an average of 9,500 SKUs with access to an additional
17,000 unique SKUs through its logistics network.

At
December 29, 2007, we operated 108 stores under the “Autopart International”
trade name in the following states throughout the Northeast:

      result of our AI acquisition. 




 





Seasonality

Our
business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the
spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather
conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as
elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or cold
weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an
accelerated rate.

Team
Members

At
February 22, 2008, we employed 25,499 full-time team members and 18,566
part-time team members. Our workforce consisted of 88% of our team members
employed in store-level operations, 9% employed in distribution and 3% employed
in our corporate offices. We have never experienced any labor disruption and are
not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our team
member relations are good.

Intellectual
Property

We own a
number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service
marks and trademarks, including “Advance Auto Parts,” “Western Auto,” “Parts
America,” “Autopart International” and “PDQ” for use in connection with the
automotive parts retailing business. In addition, we own and have registered a
number of trademarks for our proprietary products. We believe that these trade
names, service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy.
We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of
these trade names and marks, and we actively defend and enforce
them.

Competition

We
operate in both the DIY and DIFM markets of the automotive aftermarket industry.
Our primary competitors are (i) both national and regional retail chains of
automotive parts stores, including AutoZone, Inc., O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.,
CSK Auto Corporation and The Pep Boys–Manny, Moe & Jack, (ii) discount
stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products, (iii) wholesalers
or jobber stores, including those associated with national parts distributors or
associations, such as NAPA and Carquest, (iv) independent operators and (v)
automobile dealers that supply parts. We believe that chains of automotive parts
stores that, like us, have multiple locations in one or more markets, have
competitive advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection,
purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers
that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The
principal methods of competition in our business include store location,
availability, customer service and product offerings, quality and
price.

Environmental
Matters

We are
subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations
relating to the operation of our business, including those governing recycling
of lead-acid batteries and used oil, and ownership and operation of real
property. We sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of
our business. In addition, our customers may bring lead-acid batteries or used
oil onto our properties. We currently provide collection and recycling programs
for used automotive, lead-acid batteries and used oil at all of our stores as a
service to our customers. Pursuant to agreements with third party vendors,
lead-acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members, deposited
onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected
by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal. The terms of our
contracts with the third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations. Persons who arrange for the removal,
disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal,
treatment or other site affected by such substances.  Based on our
experience, we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs
associated with the current business practice of accepting lead-acid batteries
and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third
parties.

We own
and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations, a
current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the
cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in
such property. These laws often impose joint and several liability and may be
imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Other
environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose
liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work
place, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real
properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to
released hazardous substances. From time to time, we receive notices from the
Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating
that there may be contamination on properties we own, lease or operate or may
have owned, leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which
we may be responsible.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has
not had a material impact on our operations to date.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Risks
Relating to Our Business

We
may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, including
increasing comparable store sales, enhancing our margins and increasing our
return on invested capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have
implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales, enhance our
margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our
earnings and cash flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if we are
unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively, our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely
affected.

Successful
implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the
retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond
our control. Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our
business strategy:
 








·




general
      economic conditions and conditions in our local markets, which could
      reduce our sales;





·



the
      competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and
      accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices beyond our
      normal control or increase promotional
    spending;





·



changes
      in the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry, such as
      consolidation, which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor
      relationships;





·



our
      ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences and/or
      needs for automotive products (particularly parts availability),
      accessories and services in a timely
manner;





·



our
      ability to stimulate DIY customer traffic;
  and





·



our
      continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, which depends in
      part on the types of recruiting, training, compensation and benefit
      programs we adopt or
maintain.








 


We
will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not
successful, which could negatively impact our financial results.

We have
increased our store count significantly from 814 stores at the end of 1997 to
3,261 stores at December 29, 2007. We intend to continue to expand our base of
stores as part of our growth strategy, primarily by opening new stores. We may
not assure you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful. The
actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a
number of factors, including, among other things:
 









·



our
      ability to manage the expansion and hire, train and retain qualified sales
      associates;




·


the
      availability of potential store locations in highly visible,
      well-trafficked areas; and




·


the
      negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new
      locations.







 



We may
not assure you that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely
or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we
already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store
sales. The newly opened and existing stores' profitability will depend on our
ability to properly merchandise, market and price the products required in their
respective markets.

Furthermore,
we may acquire stores or businesses from, make investments in, or enter into
strategic alliances with, companies that have stores or distribution networks in
our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence. Any
future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts will be
accompanied by risks, including:
 



 






·





the
      difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners or acquisition
      candidates;






·




the
      difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the
      respective
entities;



















·





the
      potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our
      management's attention;






·




the
      inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
      policies; and






·




the
      impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of
      changes in
management.

Table of Contents


 
We may
not assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other
problems encountered with these acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances
or related efforts. If we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or
make strategic acquisitions or alliances, then our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.
 

If
overall demand for products sold by our stores slows, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows will suffer.

Overall
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for
any number of reasons, including:

 






·





the
      weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of
      unfavorable weather;






·




the
      economy, as during periods of good economic conditions, more of our DIY
      customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of
      working on their own cars. In periods of declining economic conditions,
      including higher fuel prices, higher credit costs, possible recession and
      other factors, both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance
      or repair;






·




the
      decline of the average age of vehicles, miles driven or number of cars on
      the road may result in a reduction in the demand for our product
      offerings; and






·

the
      refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available to the automotive
      aftermarket industry diagnostic, repair and maintenance information that
      our DIY and DIFM customers require to diagnose, repair and maintain their
      vehicles may force consumers to have all diagnostic work, repairs and
      maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer
      network.






 

If any of
these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will
suffer.

We depend on the services of many
qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified
team members.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience
of our many team members. At February 25, 2008, we employed 44,065 team members.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team
members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may
be needed in the future. Our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified
team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation
and benefits package. If we fail to maintain such a package, our customer
service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of
our workforce, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

If
we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive
aftermarket industry, we could lose customers and our revenues may
decline.

The sale
of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in
many ways, including location, price, name recognition and customer service. We
compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the automotive aftermarket
industry, and primarily with (i) national and regional retail automotive parts
chains, (ii) discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive
products, (iii) wholesalers or jobber stores, (iv) independent operators and (v)
automobile dealers that supply parts. These competitors and the level of
competition vary by market. Some of our competitors may possess advantages over
us in certain markets we share, including a greater amount of marketing
activities, a larger number of stores, longer operating histories, greater name
recognition or larger and more established customer bases. Our response to these
competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal
control or increase our promotional spending, which would lower revenue and
profitability. Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing
new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or
change some of our current operating strategies. If we do not have the resources
or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these
competitive disadvantages, we could lose customers and our revenues may
decline.

Table of Contents


 
Disruptions
in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors' operations could increase
our cost of goods sold.

Our
business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our
vendors and upon the vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality products to
us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm
these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us
products on favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties
that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we
purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them. In
addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may
disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less
competition and, consequently, higher prices.

Because
we are involved in litigation from time to time, and are subject to numerous
laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines,
legal fees and other costs.

We are
sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or
other third parties for various actions. From time to time, we are involved in
litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract,
tortious conduct, employment discrimination, payment of wages, asbestos
exposure, real estate matters and product defects. The damages sought against us
in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain
liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims
greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a
claim, it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating
results.

Additionally,
we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental
regulations relating to employment matters, environmental protection, product
quality standards and building and zoning requirements. If we fail to comply
with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental
or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenses could increase
due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be
noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

War
or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability
of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

War or
acts of terrorism, or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on our
ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our
merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult
or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such
merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins
may be negatively affected.

In the
event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our
business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping
merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.

Risks
Relating to Our Financial Condition

The
covenants governing our revolving and term loan facilities impose restrictions
on us.

The terms
of our revolving and term loan facilities impose operating and financial
restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial
tests. These restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by significantly
limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions,
including:


 






·





incurring
      or guaranteeing additional
  indebtedness;






·




making
      capital expenditures and other
    investments;
















·




incurring
      liens on our assets and engaging in sale-leaseback
      transactions;






·




issuing
      or selling capital stock of our
      subsidiaries;






·




transferring
      or selling assets currently held by us;
    and






·




engaging
      in mergers or
acquisitions.

The
failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our
credit facilities. Furthermore, our credit facilities contain certain financial
covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio,
which, if not maintained by us, will cause us to be in default under our credit
facilities. Any of these defaults, if not waived, could result in the
acceleration of all of our debt, in which case the debt would become immediately
due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow
sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were available, it may
be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to
us.

Item 3.

 

Legal
      Proceedings.




 



We
currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the
conduct of our business, including litigation arising from claims of employment
discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by
current and former employees. Although we diligently defend against these
claims, we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other
lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is
in the best interests of our shareholders. The damages claimed against us in
some of these proceedings are substantial. Although the amount of liability that
may result from these matters cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe
that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our
consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or cash
flow.

Our
Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including automobile
manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been
named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products. We and some of our other subsidiaries also have
been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged
that these products were manufactured, distributed and/or sold by the various
defendants. To date, these products have included brake and clutch parts and
roofing materials. Many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are
in the early stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the defendants in
some of these proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive
parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared
bankruptcy, which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages
from those defendants. Although we diligently defend against these claims, we
may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and
may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in the best
interests of our shareholders. We also believe that most of these claims are at
least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, we do not
believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us.
However, if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims
and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these claims
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial
position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against us or any of our
subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding these
claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and
liquidity in future periods.

Our
      fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday nearest to
      December 31.  All fiscal years presented are 52 weeks, with the
      exception of fiscal 2003, which consists of 53
  weeks.









(2)



The
      statement of operations data for each of the years presented reflects the
      operating results of the wholesale distribution segment as discontinued
      operations.









(3)



Selling,
      general and administrative expenses exclude certain charges disclosed
      separately and discussed in note (4)
  below.









(4)



Represents
      certain expenses related to, among other things, overlapping
      administrative functions and store conversions as a result of the Discount
      acquisition.









(5)



Basic
      and diluted shares outstanding for each of the years presented gives
      effect to a 3-for-2 stock split effectuated by us in the form of a 50%
      stock dividend distributed on September 23, 2005 and a 2-for-1 stock split
      effectuated by us in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on
      January 2, 2004.









(6)



Inventory
      turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average of
      beginning and ending inventories.  The fiscal 2003 cost of sales
      excludes the effect of the 53rd
      week in the amount of $34.3
million.









(7)



Inventory
      per store is calculated as ending inventory divided by ending store count.
      For fiscal 2003, ending inventory used in this calculation excludes
      certain inventory related to the wholesale distribution segment. The
      wholesales distribution segment, which was discontinued in fiscal 2003,
      consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations, for which
      the Company supplied merchandise
  inventory.









(8)



Accounts
      payable to inventory ratio is calculated as ending accounts payable
      divided by ending inventory. Beginning in fiscal 2004, as a result of our
      new vendor financing program, we aggregate financed vendor accounts
      payable with accounts payable to calculate our accounts payable to
      inventory ratio.









(9)



Net
      working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from
      current assets.









(10)



Net
      debt includes total debt and bank overdrafts, less cash and cash
      equivalents.











(11)



Comparable
      store sales is calculated based on the change in net sales starting once a
      store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods (each period
      represents four weeks). Relocations are included in comparable store sales
      from the original date of opening.  We do not include net sales
      from the Offshore and AI stores in our comparable store calculation. In
      2003, the comparable store sales calculation included sales from our
      53rd
      week compared to our first week of operation in 2003 (the comparable
      calendar week). In 2004, as a result of the 53rd
      week in 2003, the comparable store sales calculation excluded week one of
      sales from 2003.

Management's
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations.




 


The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data," our
consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements
that appear elsewhere in this report. Our discussion contains forward-looking
statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties,
such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and
the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those
set forth under “Forward Looking Statements” and "Risk Factors" elsewhere in
this report.

Our
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31 of each year, which results
in an extra week every several years (our next 53-week fiscal year is 2008). Our
first quarter consists of 16 weeks, and the other three quarters consist of 12
weeks.

Introduction

We
primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles). We currently are the second
largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, and “do-it-for-me,” or DIFM, customers in the
United States, based on store count and sales. At December 29, 2007, we operated
3,261 stores throughout 40 states.

We
operate in two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts, or AAP, and Autopart
International, or AI.  The AAP segment is comprised of our store
operations within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which
operate under the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,” “Advance Discount Auto
Parts” and “Western Auto.” At December 29, 2007, we operated 3,153 stores in the
AAP segment, of which 3,123 stores operated under the trade names “Advance Auto
Parts” and “Advance Discount Auto Parts” throughout 40 states in the
Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States. These
stores offer automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance
items.  In addition, we operated 30 stores under the “Western Auto”
and “Advance Auto Parts” trade names, located in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands, or Offshore.

At
December 29, 2007, we operated 108 stores in the AI segment under the “Autopart
International” trade name. We acquired AI in September 2005, and AI operates as
an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary. AI’s business primarily serves the
commercial market from its store locations. In addition, its North American
Sales Division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout North
America.

The
following table sets forth the total number of new, closed and relocated stores
and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.
We lease approximately 81% of our stores.

(b)


Of
      the 62 new stores in 2005, 61 stores were acquired in September 2005 as a
      result of our AI acquisition.




 

We
anticipate adding approximately 100 AAP and 15 AI stores during
2008.

Management
Overview

We
recorded earnings per diluted share of $2.28 in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.16
for fiscal 2006. We continue to generate significant operating cash flow to
allow us to invest in business initiatives and return capital to shareholders
through cash dividends and share repurchases.  We remain focused on
increasing our sales, operating margins and return on invested capital and
believe certain strategic initiatives introduced during 2007 are beginning to
propel us toward achieving these goals. Specific updates on these initiatives,
among other recent developments, during 2007 are discussed below:

New CEO –
We announced in November 2007 the appointment of a new CEO and President, Darren
Jackson, which became effective in January 2008. Mr. Jackson, who previously
served on our Audit Committee, Finance Committee and Board of Directors, had
already been involved with management on the completion of certain strategic
studies during 2007 and the formulation of certain initiatives discussed
below.

Sales
Initiatives – We
believe our biggest opportunity is increasing our top line sales growth as we
develop initiatives around a more customer-focused strategy and increased parts
availability and related knowledge by the team members in our stores. Our sales
per square foot and sales per employee are currently in the bottom half of the
automotive aftermarket industry. In 2007, we began implementing our plan to
increase DIY and DIFM sales through improving parts availability with an
emphasis on late model and foreign vehicles. Our enhanced parts availability
will be funded partially from available working capital as we transition from
other less productive inventory.

We
believe our DIFM business has started to improve as indicated by an 8.2%
comparable store sales increase during the fourth quarter, although we continue
to face a challenging macroeconomic environment, including higher fuel and
credit costs faced by our customers, higher unemployment and lower consumer
confidence. In order to structure our DIFM business for further growth, we
continue to examine store staffing and training, compensation policies and truck
utilization. Commercial sales represented approximately 27% of our total sales
for fiscal 2007 as compared to approximately 25% for fiscal 2006. At December
29, 2007, we operated commercial programs in 83% of our total AAP stores
compared to 81% for the prior fiscal year. Lastly, we began improving the
productivity and efficiency of our sales floor in our stores by aligning
functions performed by our sales associates with our increased parts focus,
including the transition of less productive inventory.

SG&A
Structure – We took significant steps towards reducing and reallocating
our selling, general and administrative expense structure during the second half
of 2007.  We eliminated 250 positions at our store support center and
other field support areas and terminated our Advance TV network, which together
resulted in $6.3 million of expense recognized in our 2007 operating
results.  Additionally, we reduced our real estate development by
opening fewer new stores, relocating fewer stores and halting the 2010 store
remodel program. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we introduced a 6,000 square
foot prototype store. We believe this smaller model can support an adequate
level of parts availability for both our DIY and DIFM customers while reducing
our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales.

Lastly,
we completed the further reduction and reallocation of certain advertising
expenditures into a more focused effort in electronic media. We have recently
introduced a new brand, “Keep the Wheels Turning.” This campaign was developed
as part of our overall strategic review of the business as well as extensive
research conducted with our customers and team members. We believe this
campaign, which targets both DIY and DIFM customers, differentiates Advance Auto
Parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand name parts and
products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers
keep their vehicles running. The campaign includes creative and compelling
television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring,
positive image of Advance Auto Parts. Due to the reallocation of our advertising
expenditures, we expect 2008 advertising expense to remain generally consistent
with 2007 levels.

Return on
Invested Capital Improvements – We eliminated certain
information technology, logistics and other investments that did not demonstrate
acceptable returns. During the second half of 2007, we halted our store remodel
program while we more closely examine the sales results and overall return from
these remodels. Additionally, we have
delayed the opening of our ninth distribution center to the beginning of 2010 as
a result of fewer new store openings planned throughout 2008.

Stock Repurchase
Program – During 2007, our Board
of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of
our common stock plus related expenses.  The program, which became
effective August 8, 2007, replaced the remaining portion of a $300 million stock
repurchase program. During 2007, we repurchased 8.3 million shares of common
stock for $286 million. Refer to further discussion of this program in the Liquidity section of this
management’s discussion and analysis.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies
generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis
of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these
financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the
application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and
judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently
available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are
reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The
preparation of our financial statements included the following significant
estimates.

Vendor
Incentives

We
receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their
products through a variety of programs, including cooperative advertising
allowances, volume rebates and other promotional incentives.  We
account for vendor incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or
EITF, No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
Consideration Received from a Vendor.”  Many of the incentives are
under long-term agreements (terms in excess of one year), while others are
negotiated on an annual basis.  Cooperative advertising allowances and
volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as
a reduction to inventory.  The deferred amounts are included as a
reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

We
recognize other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements as a
reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized based on the
cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over
the life of the agreement. Our margins could be impacted positively or
negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our
estimates; however, the impact over the life of the agreement would be the
same.  Short-term incentives (terms less than one year) are recognized
as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements.

Amounts
received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as
deferred revenue. Management's estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that
will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other
current liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are
included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after
one year, which is included in other assets.

Inventory
Reserves

We
establish reserves for inventory shrink, as an increase to our cost of sales,
for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent
cycle counting program. Our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the
accuracy of the program, which is dependent on compliance rates of our
facilities and the execution of the required procedures. We evaluate the
accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable
assurance for the established reserves.  If estimates regarding our
cycle counting program are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that
could be material.
 
We have
recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on
current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and current
market conditions.  The nature of our inventory is such that the risk
of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned
to our vendors for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit is
expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail
prices that are less than recorded cost. We develop these estimates based on the
determination of return privileges with vendors, the level of credit provided by
the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded

cost, if
any, required by market conditions.  Our total inventory reserves
increased by $4.2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as
the result of an increase in our total shrinkage, as a percentage of
sales.

Future
changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess
inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our
consolidated statement of operations. A 10% difference in actual inventory
reserves at December 29, 2007 would have affected net income by approximately
$2.2 million.

Warranty
Reserves

Our
vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. We are responsible for
merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties
(primarily batteries). We record a reserve for future warranty claims as an
increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products
and historical claim experience. If claims experience differs from historical
levels, revisions in our estimates may be required, which could have an impact
on our consolidated statement of operations. Our warranty reserves
increased by $4.7 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in our defective return rate as well as an
increase in the sale of premium batteries. A 10% change in the warranty reserves
at December 29, 2007 would have affected net income by approximately $1.1
million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007.

Self-Insured
Reserves
 

We are
self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers' compensation and the
health care claims of our team members, although we maintain stop-loss coverage
with third-party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. Our
self-insurance program, started in 2001, has not reached full maturity. A
reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims
filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed
in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience.  Each
year, our reserve for self-insurance increases over the prior year because each
year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year
reserves being fully relieved. Generally, claims have historically taken several
years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional
reserves are added each year. Our self-insurance reserves increased by $14.0
million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily the
result of the increase in the number of workers’ compensation claims and
automobile accident claims as well as an increase in the total cost to settle
workers’ compensation claims as compared to the prior year.  The
increase in the number of claims is driven by overall growth, including an
increase in total number of stores, employees and commercial delivery
vehicles.


While we
do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our
estimates, our self-insurance reserves and corresponding selling, general and
administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs
significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions. A 10% change in
our self-insurance liabilities at December 29, 2007 would have affected net
income by approximately $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 29,
2007.

Tax
Reserves

The
determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code,
regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do
business. Our income tax returns are periodically examined by those
jurisdictions. These examinations include, among other things, auditing our
filing positions, the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the
various jurisdictions. At any particular time, multiple years are subject to
examination by various taxing authorities.

The
accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of FIN 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” or FIN 48, on December 31, 2006. Refer to Note
12 for further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 48 and change in
reserves during fiscal 2007.

In
evaluating our income tax positions, we record reserves for potential exposures.
These tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to
such change. Those developments could be, but are not limited to; settlement of
tax audits, expiration of the statute of limitations, and the evolution of tax
code and 






23





Table of Contents


 
regulations, along with
varying application of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions.


These tax reserves
contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions
and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing
positions. Although management believes that the judgments
and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ and the company may be
exposed to gains or losses that could be material. To the extent that actual
results differ from our estimates, the effective tax rate in any particular
period could be materially affected. Favorable tax developments would be
recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
Unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate
and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution.  A 10% change
in the tax reserves at December 29, 2007 would have affected net income by
approximately $1.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 29,
2007.


Components
of Statement of Operations

Net
Sales

Net sales
consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales. We
calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once
a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods. We include
relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening. We
exclude from comparable store sales the net sales from the Offshore and AI
stores.

Cost
of Sales
 

Our cost
of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor programs;
inventory shrinkage, defective and warranty costs; and warehouse and
distribution expenses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected
by variations in our product mix, price changes in response to competitive
factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs, vendor programs, inventory
shrinkage, defective and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution costs. We
seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by
entering into long-term purchasing agreements, without minimum purchase volume
requirements, with vendors when we believe it is advantageous. Our gross profit
may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry
practice regarding the classification of certain costs. See Note 2 in our
consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these
costs.


Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll, store occupancy
(including rent), advertising expenses, other store expenses and general and
administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits of store
support center team members, share-based compensation expense, store support
center administrative office expenses, data processing, professional expenses
and other related expenses.

 Fiscal
2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

 

Net sales
for 2007 were $4,844.4 million, an increase of $227.9 million, or 4.9%, over net
sales for 2006. The net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable
store sales of 0.8% and contributions from the 196 AAP and AI stores opened
within the last year. The comparable store sales increase was driven by an
increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our DIFM business and
an increase in average ticket sales by our DIY customers offset by a decrease in
DIY customer count. We expect to experience similar trends into 2008 as we start
to experience benefits from our sales and advertising initiatives combined with
the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment. AI produced sales
of $135.0 million in 2007, an increase $23.9 million or 21.6%, compared to 2006.
AI’s sales increase was driven primarily by our acceleration of new-store growth
through 2006 and 2007.


Gross
profit for 2007 was $2,321.0 million, or 47.9% of net sales, as compared to
$2,201.2 million, or 47.7% of net sales, in 2006. The increase in gross profit
as a percentage of net sales improved procurement costs and a positive shift in
sales mix, lower logistics expense partially offset by strategic price changes
associated with our focused effort on remaining competitive in the parts
category.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses were $1,904.5 million, or 39.3% of net sales, for 2007, as compared to
$1,797.8 million, or 39.0% of net sales, for 2006. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily as a result
of an increase in certain fixed occupancy costs, as a result of lower than
anticipated sales growth, partially offset by reduced advertising
expense.

Operating
income for 2007 was $416.4 million, or 8.6% of net sales, as compared to $403.4
million, or 8.7% of net sales, in 2006. This decrease in operating income, as a
percentage of net sales, was reflective of higher selling, general and
administrative expenses as previously discussed partially offset by an increase
in gross profit. AAP produced operating income of $417.2 million, or 8.9% of net
sales, for 2007 as compared to $402.3 million, or 8.9% of net sales, in 2006. AI
generated an operating loss for 2007 of $0.8 million as compared to operating
income of $1.1 million in 2006. This decrease in operating income was primarily
driven by lower than anticipated sales, additional expenses associated with the
transition to AI’s new distribution center early in 2007 and the reinvestment of
resources to accelerate AI’s store growth and roll out of certain AI branded
product.

Interest
expense for 2007 was $34.8 million, or 0.7% of net sales, as compared to $36.0
million, or 0.8% of net sales, in 2006. The decrease in interest expense is a
result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average borrowing rates
as compared to fiscal 2006.
 






25





Table of Contents


 

Income
tax expense for 2007 was $144.3 million, as compared to $138.6 million for
2006. Our effective income tax rate was 37.7% and 37.5% for 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

We
generated net income of $238.3 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, for 2007, as
compared to $231.3 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for 2006. As a
percentage of sales, net income for 2007 was 4.9%, as compared to 5.0% for
2006.

Fiscal
2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net sales
for 2006 were $4,616.5 million, an increase of $351.5 million, or 8.2%, over net
sales for 2005.  The net sales increase was due to an increase in
comparable store sales of 2.1%, contributions from the 190 AAP stores opened
within the last year and sales from AI. AI, which was acquired in September
2005, produced sales of $111.1 million in 2006 compared to $30.3 million for the
partial period in 2005. The comparable store sales increase was driven by an
increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our DIFM business and
an increase in average ticket sales by our DIY customers offset by a decrease in
DIY customer count.

Gross
profit for 2006 was $2,201.2 million, or 47.7% of net sales, as compared to
$2,014.5 million, or 47.2% of net sales, in 2005.   The increase
in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects the positive impact of our
ongoing category management initiatives, including improved procurement costs
and a positive shift in sales mix, and logistics
efficiencies.

 
Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $1,797.8 million, or 39.0% of net
sales, for 2006, as compared to $1,606.0 million, or 37.6% of net sales, for
2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of
sales as a result of:


 






·





recording
      share-based compensation expense of approximately 0.4% of net sales upon
      the implementation of SFAS 123R on January 1,
      2006;






·




a
      0.5% increase in certain fixed costs as a percentage of sales during the
      year, including rent and depreciation, as a result of low comparable sales
      growth; and






·




a
      0.3% increase in expenses associated with higher costs for insurance
      programs, including workers’ compensation, auto liability and general
      liability.









 


Additionally,
AI contributed approximately 0.2% of selling, general and administrative
expenses as a result of the reinvestment of working capital to accelerate their
new store growth.

Interest
expense for 2006 was $36.0 million, or 0.8% of net sales, as compared to $32.4
million, or 0.7% of net sales, in 2005. The increase in interest expense is a
result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as
compared to fiscal 2005. In addition, other income for fiscal 2006 decreased as
a result of less interest income associated with lower cash balances throughout
the year.

Income
tax expense for 2006 was $138.6 million, as compared to $144.2 million for
2005.  Our effective income tax rate was 37.5% and 38.1% for 2006 and
2005, respectively.

We
generated net income of $231.3 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for 2006, as
compared to $234.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for 2005.  As
a percentage of sales, net income for 2006 was 5.0%, as compared to 5.5% for
2005. Our earnings per diluted share results reflect the impact on both earnings
and the diluted share count of implementing FAS 123R as further explained in
this management’s discussion and analysis and in the notes to our financial
statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources


Overview
of Liquidity

Our
primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory, capital
expenditures, payment of quarterly cash dividends and contractual obligations.
In addition, we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock
under our stock repurchase program and to repay borrowings under our credit
facility. We have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated
from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as
needed. We believe funds generated from our expected results of operations,
available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our term loan
and revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our primary
obligations for the next fiscal year.
 

At
December 29, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $14.7 million, an
increase of $3.5 million compared to fiscal year-end 2006. This increase
resulted from an increase in cash flow from operations and proceeds from the
exercise of stock options partially offset by the continued investment in
property and equipment, reduction in our revolving credit facility balance and
return of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and
repurchase of common stock during 2007. At December 29, 2007, our
outstanding indebtedness was $28.4 million higher when compared to 2006 and
consisted of borrowings of $451.0 million under our revolving credit facility,
$50.0 million under our term loan, and $4.7 million outstanding on an economic
development note. Additionally, we had $74.7 million in letters of credit
outstanding, which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit
facility to $224.3 million.

On
February 15, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend,
the first in our history. We have paid quarterly dividends of $0.06 per share to
stockholders of record for each of our quarters during 2006 and 2007. Subsequent
to December 29, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.06 per share to be paid on April 4, 2008 to all common stockholders of record
as of March 21, 2008.

Capital
Expenditures

Our
primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store
expansion program, including new store openings and store acquisitions, store
relocations and remodels, maintenance of existing stores, the construction and
upgrading of distribution centers, the development of proprietary information
systems, implementation of proprietary and purchased information systems and our
acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $210.6 million in 2007. During
fiscal 2007, we opened 175 AAP and 21 AI stores, remodeled 77 AAP stores and
relocated 29 AAP stores.

Our
future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and
timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of
stores we relocate or remodel. During 2008, we anticipate adding 100 new
AAP and 15 AI stores and relocating 10 to 20 AAP stores. We do not plan to
remodel any stores in 2008. We also plan to make continued investments in the
maintenance of our existing stores and logistics network as well as investing in
new information systems to support certain initiatives, including our parts
availability initiative. In 2008, we anticipate that our capital expenditures
will be approximately $170.0 million to $190.0 million.

Vendor
Financing Program

Historically,
we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance
inventory growth, and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much
of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms. We have a
short-term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases. In
substance, the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance
purchases from our vendors. This program allows us to reduce further our working
capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory
growth. Our revolving and term loan facilities do not restrict availability
under this program. At December 29, 2007, $153.5 million was payable to the bank
by us under this program.

Stock
Repurchase Program

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock
repurchase program of up to $500 million of our common stock plus related
expenses. The new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of the
previous $300 million stock repurchase program. The program allows us to
repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

During
fiscal 2007, we repurchased 8.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate
cost of $285.9 million, or an average price of $34.27 per share, of which 1.3
million shares of common stock were repurchased under the previous $300 million
stock repurchase program. As of December 29, 2007, $3.0 million of shares have
been repurchased
and remained unsettled. Subsequent to December 29, 2007, we repurchased 4.6
million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $155.4 million, or an
average price of $34.04 per share. Reflective of the subsequent repurchases, we
have remaining $105.2 million under our current stock repurchase
program.

Operating
Activities

For
fiscal 2007, net cash provided by operating activities increased $76.9 million
to $410.5 million. Net income increased by $7.0 million during fiscal 2007.
Significant changes in working capital resulted in the following sources of
cash:
 








·






a
      $41.2 million increase in cash flows from inventory, net of accounts
      payable, reflective of our slow down of inventory growth in line with our
      current sales trend, while maintaining adequate levels of inventory to
      support our parts availability initiative;
      and







·





a
      $35.7 million increase in cash flows comprised of other movements in
      working capital, including the timing in payment of certain operating
      expenses.










 



For
fiscal 2006, net cash provided by operating activities increased $12.0 million
to $333.6 million. Significant components of this increase consisted
of:

Investing
Activities

For
fiscal 2007, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $56.5 million to
$202.1 million.  Significant components of this decrease consisted
of:

 






·







a
      decrease in capital expenditures of $48.0 million resulting primarily from
      less spending on capital assets in our store locations, the impact of the
      reduced scope in remodels and fewer relocations as compared to 2006;
      and

      growth in our vendor financing
      program;









·






an
      increase of $25.3 million from the issuance of common stock, resulting
      from an increase in the exercise of stock options mainly associated with
      the departure of our former CEO and another executive officer during 2007;
      and








·



a
      $6.6 million cash inflow from additional tax benefits realized from the
      increased level of stock options
  exercised.

flows from financing activities decreased as result of:
 








·









a
      reduction of $14.3 million in net borrowings primarily under our credit

Off-Balance-Sheet
Arrangements



As of
December 29, 2007, we had outstanding $74.7 million in letters of credit and
$2.5 million of surety bonds. These items are considered off-balance-sheet
arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Contractual
Obligations

In
addition to our revolving credit facility, we also utilize operating leases as
another source of financing. The amounts payable under these operating leases
are included in our schedule of contractual obligations. Our future contractual
obligations related to long-term debt, operating leases and other contractual
obligations at December 29, 2007 were as follows:

We
      lease certain store locations, distribution centers, office space,
      equipment and vehicles. Our property leases generally contain renewal and
      escalation clauses and other concessions. These provisions are considered
      in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as
      expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. In
      accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” as amended by SFAS
      No. 29, “Determining Contingent Rental,” any lease payments that are based
      upon an existing index or rate, are included in our minimum lease payment
      calculations.









(2)



For
      the purposes of this table, purchase obligations are defined as agreements
      that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant
      terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,
      minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the
      transaction. Our open purchase orders are based on current inventory or
      operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short periods of
      time. We currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our
      vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders for goods and
      services binding agreements. Accordingly, we have excluded open purchase
      orders from this table. The purchase obligations consist of the amount of
      fuel required to be purchased by us under certain fixed price fuel supply
      agreements and certain commitments for training and development. All of
      these agreements expire in
2008.









(3)



Primarily
      includes employee benefits accruals, restructuring and closed store
      liabilities and deferred income taxes for which no contractual payment
      schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond 12 months from
      December 29, 2007. Additionally, other long-term liabilities include $20.4
      million of unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of our adoption on
      FIN 48 on December 31, 2006. During the next 12 months, it is possible
      that we could conclude on $2 to $3 million of the contingencies associated
      with these tax uncertainties, a portion of which may be settled in cash.
      We do not anticipate any significant impact on our liquidity and capital
      resources due to the conclusion of these tax
  matters.

Long Term Debt

On
December 4, 2007, we entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured four-year
term loan with our subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated, or Stores,
serving as borrower. Proceeds from this term loan will be used to
repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase
program.  As of December 29, 2007, Stores had borrowed $50.0 million under
the term loan. Subsequent to December 29, 2007, Stores borrowed the remaining
capacity under the term loan. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of
the term loan balance are permitted in whole or in part, at our option, in
minimum principal amounts as specified in the new term loan.

In
addition to the term loan, we have in place a $750.0 million unsecured five-year
revolving credit facility with Stores serving as the borrower. This
facility was entered into in October 2006 and replaced our term loans and
revolver under the previous credit facility. Proceeds from this revolving loan
facility were used to repay $433.8 million of principal outstanding on our term
loans and revolver under our previous credit facility. In conjunction with
this refinancing, we wrote-off existing deferred financing costs related to our
previous term loans and revolver.  The write-off of these costs of
$1.9 million was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate
swaps of $2.9 million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million
during fiscal year 2006.

The
revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit
with a sub limit of $300.0 million and swingline loans in an amount not to
exceed $50.0 million. We may request that the total revolving commitment be
increased by an amount not exceeding $250.0 million during the term of the
credit agreement. Voluntary prepayments
and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in
part, at our option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving
credit facility.


As of
December 29, 2007, we had borrowed $451.0 million under the revolver and had
$74.7 million in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under
the revolver to $224.3 million. In addition, we had outstanding $4.7 million
under an economic development note. We also maintain approximately $2.5
million in surety bonds issued by our insurance provider primarily to utility
providers and the departments of revenue for certain states. These letters of
credit and surety bonds generally have a term of one year or less.

The
interest rate on the term loan will be based, at our option, on an
adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a
margin. The initial margin is 1.00% and 0.0% per annum for the adjusted
LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. We have elected to use
the 90-day adjusted LIBOR rate and has the ability and intent to continue to use
this rate on its hedged borrowings. A commitment fee will be charged on the
unused portion of the term loan, payable in arrears. The initial commitment fee
rate is 0.200% per annum. Under the terms of the term loan, the interest
rate spread and commitment fee will be based on our credit rating. The term
loan terminates on October 5, 2011.

The
interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be based,
at our option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base
rate, plus a margin. The current margin is 0.75% and 0.0% per annum for the
adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. We have elected
to use the 90-day adjusted LIBOR rate and have the ability and intent to
continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings. A commitment fee will be
charged on the unused portion of the revolver, payable in arrears. The current
commitment fee rate is 0.150% per annum. Under the terms of the revolving credit
facility, the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on our
credit rating. The revolving facility terminates on October 5,
2011.

The term
loan and revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Our debt agreements collectively
contain covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among
other things, (1) create, incur or assume additional debt (including hedging
arrangements), (2) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (3)
make loans and investments, (4) guarantee obligations, (5) engage in certain
mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (6) change the nature of our business and
the business conducted by our subsidiaries and (7) change our holding company
status. We are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to
a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio. The
revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default,
including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults to our
other material indebtedness. We were in compliance with these covenants at
December 29, 2007.

Credit
Ratings

At
December 29, 2007, we had a credit rating from Standard & Poor’s of BB+ and
a credit rating of Ba1 from Moody’s Investor Service. The current pricing grid
used to determine our borrowing rates under our revolving credit facility is
based on such credit ratings. If these credit ratings decline, our interest
expense may increase. Conversely, if these credit ratings improve, our interest
expense may decrease.


Recent
Accounting Developments

Share-Based
Compensation

We have
share-based compensation plans as allowed under our long-term incentive plan, or
LTIP. Historically, we have granted fixed stock options and deferred stock
units, or DSUs, to our employees under these plans. Beginning in fiscal 2007, we
granted primarily stock appreciation rights, or SARs, and restricted stock, or
unvested shares. We continue to grant DSUs to members of our board of directors
and, beginning in 2008, we will grant SARs to our board members rather than
stock options.

The terms
of the SARs authorized to be granted are essentially the same as our previously
granted stock options. The SARs are non-qualified and terminate on the seventh
anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, they vest over a three-year period
in equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant
date and contain no post-vesting restrictions other than normal trading
black-out periods prescribed by our corporate governance
policies. We continue to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all
awards and the straight-line method to amortize this fair value as compensation
cost over the requisite service period.


The
unvested shares vest at the end of a three-year period. During this period,
holders of the unvested shares are entitled to dividend and voting rights. The
unvested shares are restricted until they vest and cannot be sold by the
recipient until the restriction has lapsed at the end of the three-year period.
The fair value of unvested shares is determined based on the market price of our
common stock on the date of grant.

Total
share-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for fiscal
years 2007 and 2006 is $18.1 million and $19.1 million, respectively. We
recognized a nominal amount of share-based compensation during fiscal year 2005
since the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," or
SFAS 123R, was effective at the beginning of fiscal 2006.  For a
complete discussion of the adoption of SFAS 123R, see Note 2 of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. As of December 29, 2007, we have $19.5
million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested share-based
awards we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.8
years.

Income
Taxes

Effective
December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48.  FIN 48 clarifies
the accounting and reporting for income taxes recognized in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in income tax returns. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48 on December
31, 2006, we recorded an increase of $2.3 million to the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding decrease in our balance of
retained earnings. For a complete discussion of the adoption of FIN 48, see Note
12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of
the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as
an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize
changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the
changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a

Table of Contents


 
plan as
of the date of the statement of financial position. We adopted the recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006 and recorded a reduction to the
liability of $5.4 million and increase to other comprehensive income of $3.3
million, net of tax (see Note 15). SFAS No. 158 is effective for the measurement
date provisions for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 158
provides two approaches to transition to a fiscal year-end measurement date,
both of which are to be applied prospectively. We have elected to apply the
alternate transition method under which a 14-month measurement will cover the
period from November 1, 2007 through December 29, 2007. We do not expect the
change in the measurement date to have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value as it related to other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements, and expands the disclosures on fair
value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued a staff position that
delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed at least annually. Except
for the delay for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods
within such years. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting
SFAS No. 157.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. We are currently evaluating
the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 159.

December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations,” which
replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”  SFAS No. 141R, among other
things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any controlling interests in the acquired
entity; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information
to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination. Costs of the acquisition
will be recognized separately from the business combination. SFAS No. 141R
applies to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51.” SFAS No. 160,
among other things, provides guidance and establishes amended accounting and
reporting standards for a parent company’s noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a
material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.
 






Item 7A.

 

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risks.




 


We are
exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our
long-term debt. Our long-term debt primarily consists of borrowings under a
revolving and term loan credit facilities and is primarily vulnerable to
movements in the LIBOR rate. While we cannot predict the impact interest rate
movements will have on our debt, exposure to rate changes is managed through the
use of hedging activities.

Our
future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of entering into
an interest rate swap in fiscal 2007 on an aggregate $50 million of debt under
our term loan and four interest rate swap agreements in fiscal 2006 on an
aggregate of $225 million of debt under our revolving credit facility. The
interest rate swaps entered into during 2006 replaced the previously outstanding
swaps terminated as a result of our refinancing in October 2006.

At
December 29, 2007, our outstanding swaps fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate on an
aggregate of $275 million of hedged debt at rates ranging from 4.01% to 4.98%.
All of the swaps expire in October 2011.

The table
below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates
on our long-term debt outstanding at December 29, 2007, by expected maturity
dates. Additionally, the table includes the notional amounts of our hedged debt
and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest
rate swaps through

maturity dates. Expected maturity dates approximate contract terms. Weighted
average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at
December 29, 2007. Implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of
actual future interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL
REPORTING


Management
of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule 13(a) – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

As of
December 29, 2007, management, including the Company’s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 29, 2007 is effective. Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Deloitte
& Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an
attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 29, 2007 which is included on page F-3 herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries
Roanoke,
Virginia

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto Parts, Inc.
and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2007.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
29, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

As
discussed in Notes 2, 12, 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions to
conform to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, in 2007, its method of accounting for share-based payments
to conform to FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, in 2006,
and changed its method of accounting for other postretirement benefits to
conform to FASB Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), in 2006.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries
Roanoke,
Virginia

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Advance Auto Parts,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on the criteria
established in Internal
Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 29, 2007 of the Company and our report dated
February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of new
accounting standards.

data)
 


1.
Organization and Description of Business:

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. (“Advance”) conducts all of its operations through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (“Stores”) and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).  The Company operates
3,153 stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The
Company operates 3,123 stores throughout 40 states in the Northeastern,
Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States.  These
stores operate under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for certain
stores in the State of Florida which operate under the “Advance Discount Auto
Parts” trade name. These stores offer a broad selection of brand name and
proprietary automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items for
domestic and imported cars and light trucks.  In addition, the Company
operates 30 stores under the “Western Auto” and “Advance Auto Parts” trade
names, located in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Autopart International, an
independently run subsidiary of Stores, operates 108 stores under the “Autopart
International” trade name throughout the Northeastern region of the United
States.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Accounting
Period

The
Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December, which
results in an extra week every several years (the next 53 week fiscal year is
2008). All fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of operations.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
 

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Bank Overdrafts


Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds with original
maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts consist of outstanding
checks not yet presented to a bank for settlement, net of cash held in accounts
with right of offset.

Vendor
Incentives

The
Company receives incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or
payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume
rebates and other promotional considerations. The Company accounts for vendor
incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16,
“Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives are under long-term agreements
(terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated on an annual basis.
Cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on
inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory. The
deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory
is sold since these payments do not represent reimbursements for specific,
incremental and identifiable costs. Total deferred vendor incentives in
inventory is $39,118 and $35,393 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
respectively.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS - (Continued)
December 29, 2007, December 30,
2006 and December 31, 2005
(in thousands, except per share
data)

 
The
Company recognizes other promotional incentives earned under long-term
agreements as a reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized
based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net
purchases over the life of the agreement. The Company's margins could be
impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one
year differ from its estimates; however, the impact over the life of the
agreement would be the same. Short-term incentives (terms less than one year)
are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the
agreements.

Amounts
received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as
deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Management's
estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one
year of the balance sheet date has been included in other current liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total deferred revenue is $9,238
and $8,006 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. Earned
amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables, net except
for that portion expected to be received after one year, which is included in
other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Preopening
Expenses

Preopening
expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed
as incurred.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in
tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the
period of the enactment date.
 
The
Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets
will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, the Company
considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled
reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax
planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event the
Company was to determine that it would be able to realize the Company’s deferred
income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the
Company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce
the provision for income taxes.
 
In July
2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” or FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 provides that a tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits.
 
Income
tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the
effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent
periods. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement,
derecognition of benefits, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 48 on December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 12 for further
discussion of income taxes and the impact of adopting FIN 48.
 
Advertising
Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s Statement of Position, or SOP, 93-7,
“Reporting on Advertising Costs.” Gross advertising expense incurred was
approximately $78,823, $97,215 and $95,702 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Insurance

The
Company is self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers'
compensation and the health care claims of its team members although the Company
maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit its total
liability exposure.  Liabilities associated with these losses are
calculated for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using
actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s
historical claims experience.  The following table presents changes in
the Company’s self-insurance reserves.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to customers. The
majority of sales are made for cash and credit with no recourse; however, the
Company extends credit to certain commercial customers through a third-party
provider of private label credit cards. Receivables under the private label
credit card program are generally transferred to a third-party provider with no
recourse.  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on
receivables sold with recourse based upon factors related to credit risk of
specific customers, historical trends and other information.

Sales
Returns and Allowances

The
Company’s accounting policy for sales returns and allowances consists of
establishing reserves for estimated returns at the time of sale. The Company
estimates returns based on current sales levels and the Company’s historical
return experience on a specific product basis. The Company’s reserve for sales
returns and allowances was not significant at December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006.

Sales
Taxes

The
Company presents sales net of sales taxes in its consolidated statements of
operations.

Share-Based
Payments

Prior to
January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its share-based compensation plans as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” or APB No. 25. The Company recorded no
compensation cost in its statement of operations prior to fiscal 2006 for its
fixed stock option grants as the exercise price equaled the fair market value of
the underlying stock on the grant date. In addition, the Company did not
recognize compensation expense for its employee stock purchase plan since it
qualified as a non-compensatory plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. The Company did recognize an insignificant amount of
share-based compensation expense related to the grant of deferred stock units to
its Board of Directors.

On
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised
2004), "Share-Based Payment," or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No.
123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and subsequently issued stock option
related guidance. The Company elected to use the modified-prospective method of
implementation. Under this transition method, share-based compensation expense
for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 included compensation expense for
all share-based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
123R, and compensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to but
unvested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with original provisions of SFAS No. 123.

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all awards and the
straight-line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the
requisite service period. Total share-based compensation expense included in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007 and
December 30, 2006 were $18,096 and $19,052, respectively. The related income tax
benefit was $6,822 and $7,145 for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007 and
December 30, 2006, respectively. The Company recognized $363 of share-based
compensation expense in accordance with APB No. 25 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005. In accordance with the modified-prospective transition method
of SFAS No. 123R, the Company has not restated prior periods.

As a
result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company’s earnings
before income tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended December
29, 2007, were $17,753 and $11,060 lower, respectively, than if the Company had
continued to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. As a result
of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company’s earnings before
income tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006,
were $18,767 and $11,730 lower, respectively, than if the Company had continued
to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. The related impact in
fiscal years 2007 and 2006 to basic and diluted earnings per share is
$0.11.

In
November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3 “Transition
Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.”
We elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff
Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation. The
alternative transition method includes simplified methods to determine the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital (APIC) pool related to the
tax effects of stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact
on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flow of the tax effects of
stock-based awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R.

Prior to
the adoption of SFAS No.123R, the Company reported the benefit of tax deductions
in excess of recognized stock compensation expense, or excess tax benefits,
resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in its
consolidated statements of cash flows. In accordance with SFAS No.123R, the
Company revised its statement of cash flows presentation prospectively to
include these excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as
financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows. Accordingly, for the
fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, the Company reported
$11,841 and $5,272, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a financing cash
inflow.

The

Earnings
Per Share of Common Stock

Basic
earnings per share of common stock has been computed based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, less stock held in
treasury and shares of non-vested restricted stock, during the period. Diluted
earnings per share of common stock reflects the increase in the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding, outstanding deferred stock units
and the impact of outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and
shares of unvested restricted stock  (collectively “share-based
awards”), calculated on the treasury stock method as modified by the adoption of
SFAS 123R. There were 3,192, 2,140 and 517 antidilutive share-based awards for
the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31,
2005, respectively.

Hedge
Activities
 
The
Company utilizes interest rate swaps to limit its cash flow risk on its variable
rate debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” the fair value of the Company’s outstanding
hedges is recorded as an asset or liability in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
respectively. The Company uses the 90-day, adjusted LIBOR interest rate and has
the intent and ability to continue to use this rate on its hedged borrowings.
Accordingly, the Company does not recognize any ineffectiveness on the swaps as
allowed under Derivative Implementation Group Issue No. G7, “Cash Flow Hedges:
Measuring the Ineffectiveness of a Cash Flow Hedge under Paragraph 30(b) When
the Shortcut Method Is Not Applied” and has recorded all adjustments to the fair
value of the hedge instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income through
the maturity date of the applicable hedge arrangement.

During
fiscal 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap on an aggregate of
$50,000 of debt under its term loan. Additionally, the Company has outstanding
four interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $225,000 of debt
under its revolving credit facility. These four swaps were entered in October
2006 in connection with the termination of its previous three interest rate
swaps. Accordingly, the Company recognized income of $2,873 in fiscal 2006
resulting from the reclassification of the previously unrealized gain from other
comprehensive income. The Company’s currently outstanding swaps have fixed the
Company’s LIBOR rate on an aggregate of $275,000 of hedged debt at rates ranging
from 4.01% to 4.98%. All of the swaps expire in October 2011.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the
Company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at
least on an annual basis or if circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Testing
for impairment is a two-step process as prescribed in SFAS No. 142. The first
step is a review for potential impairment, while the second step measures the
amount of impairment, if any. The Company has elected to complete its annual
impairment test as of the first day of its fourth quarter. An impairment loss
would be recognized when the assets’ fair value is below their carrying
value.

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets under the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 requires the review for impairment of
long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its fair
value.

Significant
factors, which would trigger an impairment review, include the
following:
 







·




Significant
      negative industry trends;





·



Significant
      changes in technology;





·



Significant
      underutilization of assets; and





·

Significant
      changes in how assets are used or are planned to be
  used.






 









When such
an event occurs, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. These impairment
evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows. If
the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of
the asset and the

carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
Management utilizes an expected present value technique, which uses a risk-free
rate and multiple cash flow scenarios reflecting the range of possible outcomes,
to estimate fair value of the asset. Actual useful lives and cash flows could
differ from those estimated
by management using these techniques, which could have a material affect on our
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Financed
Vendor Accounts Payable

The
Company is party to a short-term financing program with a bank allowing it to
extend its payment terms on certain merchandise purchases. The substance of the
program is for the Company to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases
from vendors. The Company records any discount given by the vendor to the value
of its inventory and accretes this discount to the resulting short-term payable
to the bank through interest expense over the extended term. At December 29,
2007 and December 30, 2006, $153,549 and $127,543, respectively, was payable to
the bank by the Company under this program and is included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets as Financed Vendor Accounts Payable.

Lease
Accounting

The
Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office space,
equipment and vehicles. Initial terms for facility leases are typically 10 to 15
years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five year
intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. The total amount of the
minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the
lease unless external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably
assured, in which case the Company would include the renewal period in its
amortization period. In those instances the renewal period would be included in
the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and
determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease. In addition
to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent facility rentals.
Contingent facility rentals are determined on the basis of a percentage of sales
in excess of stipulated minimums for certain store facilities as defined in the
individual lease agreements. Most of the leases provide that the Company pay
taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the
leased premises and include options to renew. Management expects that, in the
normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
other leases.

Closed
Store Liabilities

The
Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing store
locations and closes certain locations identified as under performing. The
Company evaluates and determines if closing an under performing location results
in the elimination of the operations and associated cash flows from the
Company’s ongoing operations or if the Company transferred those operations to
another location in the local market. The Company maintains closed store
liabilities that include liabilities for these exit activities.

New
provisions established for closed store liabilities include the present value of
the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of
insurance, property tax and common area maintenance reduced by the present value
of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts and are established by a
charge to selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations at the time the facilities actually
close.

From time
to time these estimates require revisions that affect the amount of the recorded
liability. This change in estimate relates primarily to changes in assumptions
associated with the revenue from subleases. The effect of changes in estimates
for the closed store liabilities and included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. Closed store liabilities are recorded in accrued expenses (current
portion) and other long-term liabilities (long-term portion) in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of
the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as
an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize
changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the
changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a
plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. The Company adopted
the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006 and recorded a
reduction to the liability of $5,357 and increase to other comprehensive income
of $3,316, net of tax (see Note 15). SFAS No. 158 is effective for the
measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
SFAS No. 158 provides two approaches to transition to a fiscal year-end
measurement date, both of which are to be applied prospectively. The Company has
elected to apply the alternate transition method under which a 14-month
measurement will cover the period from November 1, 2007 through December 29,
2007. The Company does not expect the change in the measurement date to have a
material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value as it related to other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements, and expands the disclosures on fair
value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued a staff position that
delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed at least annually. Except
for the delay for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods
within such years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
adopting SFAS No. 157.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items

at fair
value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 159.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations,” which
replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R, among other
things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any controlling interests in the acquired
entity; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information
to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination. Costs of the acquisition
will be recognized separately from the business combination. SFAS No. 141R
applies to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51.” SFAS No. 160,
among other things, provides guidance and establishes amended accounting and
reporting standards for a parent company’s noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.
160 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

3.
Acquisitions:

On
September 14, 2005, the Company acquired Autopart International, Inc., or AI.
The acquisition, which included 61 stores throughout New England and New York, a
distribution center and AI’s wholesale distribution business, complements the
Company’s growing presence in the Northeast. AI serves the growing commercial
market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers.

The
acquisition has been accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations”, or SFAS No. 141. The total purchase price of $87,626
primarily consisted of $74,940 paid upon closing and an additional $12,500 of
contingent consideration paid in March 2006 based upon AI satisfying certain
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization targets through
December 31, 2005. Furthermore, an additional $12,500 is payable upon the
achievement of certain merchandise cost reduction synergies through fiscal 2008,
of which $11,633 has been paid as of December 29, 2007. In accordance with SFAS
No. 141, this additional payment does not represent contingent consideration and
will be reflected in the statement of operations when considered probable and
estimable. The Company recognized $8,519 and $3,114 in cost of goods sold due to
such synergies for the year ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
respectively.
 
During
the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company finalized the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company
allocated $29,000 to intangible assets based on a valuation study. A portion of
these intangible assets are subject to amortization and are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years using straight-line
methods. Remaining adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired primarily included inventory and deferred income taxes. Accordingly,
the Company’s initial goodwill balance was adjusted down to $17,625 as a result
of these adjustments, all of which is deductible for tax purposes. The following
table summarizes the final allocation of amounts assigned to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:

accounting adjustments associated with the AI acquisition (Note 3).

Catastrophic Losses and Insurance Recoveries:

During
the second half of fiscal 2005, the Company suffered losses resulting from
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma as well as two stores damaged by fire. The
Company estimated and recognized the fixed costs of these events including the
write-off of damaged merchandise at cost, damaged capital assets at net book
value and required repair costs. Moreover, these hurricanes caused significant
sales disruptions primarily from store closures, stores operating on limited
hours and lower sales trends due to evacuations. The Company also incurred and
recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating team members for
scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided
to team members and their families. While these costs and sales disruptions were
not recoverable from the Company’s insurance carrier, the Company did maintain
property insurance against the fixed costs of the related physical damage
including the recovery of damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged
capital assets at replacement cost. Prior to December 31, 2005, the Company and
the insurance carrier settled in full a claim for the retail value of certain
merchandise inventory damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. The Company
evaluated and recognized a receivable for the recovery of these fixed costs, net
of deductibles.

The
following table represents the net impact of certain insured fixed costs less
recoveries as reflected in the selling, general and administrative line of the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.

Accordingly, earnings for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006 reflected $1,143 and $1,388 of insurance recoveries, net of deductibles.
During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company collected the remainder of
its receivable from its insurance carrier related to previous catastrophic
losses.

Inventories, net

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the
last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for approximately 93% of inventories at both
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006. Under the LIFO method, the Company’s
cost of sales reflects the costs of the most currently purchased inventories
while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs relating to prices
paid in prior years. The Company’s costs to acquire inventory have been
generally decreasing in recent years as a result of its significant growth.
Accordingly, the cost to replace inventory is less than the LIFO balances
carried for similar product. As a result of the LIFO method and the ability to
obtain lower product costs, the Company recorded a reduction to cost of sales of
$11,005 and $9,978 for the fiscal years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
an increase in cost of sales of $526 for fiscal year ended 2005.

The
remaining inventories are comprised of product cores, which consist of the
non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries and are valued under the
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.  Core values are included as part
of our merchandise costs and are either passed on to the customer or returned to
the vendor.  Additionally, these products are not subject to the
frequent cost changes like our other merchandise inventory, thus, there is no
material difference from applying either the LIFO or FIFO valuation
methods.

The
Company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into
inventory.  Purchasing and warehousing costs included in inventory, at
FIFO, at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, were $107,068 and $95,576,
respectively. Inventories consist of the following:

Inventory
quantities are tracked through a perpetual inventory system. The Company uses a
cycle counting program in all distribution centers, PDQs, LAWs, and retail
stores to ensure the accuracy of the perpetual inventory quantities of both
merchandise and core inventory.

The
Company establishes reserves for estimated shrink based on historical accuracy
and effectiveness of the cycle counting program. The Company also establishes
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current
inventory levels and the historical analysis of product sales and current market
conditions. The nature of the Company’s inventory is such that the risk of
obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to
the Company’s vendors for credit. The Company provides reserves when less than
full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in
retail prices below recorded costs. The following table presents changes in the
Company’s inventory reserves.

8.  Property
and Equipment:

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred; major
improvements are capitalized. When items are sold or retired, the related cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or
loss reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation
of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles
is provided over the estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 40 years, of
the respective assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation of building
and leasehold improvements is provided over the shorter of the original useful
lives of the respective assets or the term of the lease using the straight-line
method. The term of the lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless
external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably assured in
which case, the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes
of establishing an amortization period. Depreciation expense was $146,182,
$138,064 and $119,938 for the fiscal years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

On
December 4, 2007, the Company entered into a new $200,000
unsecured four-year term loan with Stores serving as
borrower. Proceeds from this term loan will be used to repurchase shares
of the Company's common stock under its stock repurchase
program.  As of December 29, 2007, the Company had borrowed $50,000 under
the term loan. Subsequent to December 29, 2007, the Company borrowed the
remaining capacity under the term loan. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary
reductions of the term loan balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the
Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the new term
loan.

In
addition to the term loan, the Company has a $750,000 unsecured five-year
revolving credit facility with Stores serving as the borrower. This
facility was entered into in October 2006 and replaced the Company’s term loans
and revolver under its previous credit facility. Proceeds from this revolving
loan were used to repay $433,775 of principal outstanding on the Company’s term
loans and revolver under its previous credit facility. In conjunction with
this refinancing, the Company wrote-off existing deferred financing costs
related to the Company’s previous credit facility.  The write-off of
these costs of $1,887 was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest
rate swaps of $2,873 for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $986 during the
fiscal year ended December 30, 2006.

The
revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit
with a sub limit of $300,000 and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed
$50,000. The Company may request that the total revolving commitment be
increased by an amount not exceeding $250,000 during the term of the credit
agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving
balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum
principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility.
 
As of
December 29, 2007, the Company had borrowed $451,000 under the revolver and had
$74,742 in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under the
revolver to $224,258. In addition, the Company had outstanding $4,672 under an
economic development note. The Company also maintains approximately $2,488 in
surety bonds issued by its insurance provider primarily to utility providers and
the departments of revenue for certain states. These letters of credit and
surety bonds generally have a term of one year or less.

The
interest rate on the term loan will be based, at the Company’s option,
on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a
margin. The initial margin is 1.00% and 0.0% per annum for the adjusted
LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. The Company has elected
to use the 90-day adjusted LIBOR rate and has the ability and intent to continue
to use this rate on its hedged borrowings. A commitment fee will be charged on
the unused portion of the term loan, payable in arrears. The initial commitment
fee rate is 0.200% per annum. Under the terms of the term loan, the
interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on the Company’s credit
rating. The term loan terminates on October 5, 2011.

The
interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be based,
at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an
alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin is 0.75% and 0.0% per
annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively.
The Company has elected to use the 90-day adjusted LIBOR rate and has the
ability and intent to continue to use this rate on its hedged borrowings. A
commitment fee will be charged on the unused portion of the revolver, payable in
arrears. The current commitment fee rate is 0.150% per annum. Under the terms of
the revolving credit facility, the interest rate spread and commitment fee will
be based on the Company’s credit rating. The revolving facility terminates on
October 5, 2011.

The term
loan and revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
by Advance Auto Parts, Inc. The Company’s debt agreements collectively contain
covenants restricting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among
other things, (1) create, incur or assume additional debt (including hedging
arrangements), (2) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (3)
make loans and investments, (4) guarantee obligations, (5) engage in certain
mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (6) change the nature of the Company’s
business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and (7) change the
holding company status of the Company. The Company is required to comply with
financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum
consolidated coverage ratio. The revolving credit facility also provides for
customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults
and cross-defaults to the Company’s other material indebtedness. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 29,
2007.

At
December 29, 2007, the aggregate future annual maturities of long-term debt

Stock Repurchase Program:

During
fiscal 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase
program of up to $500,000 of the Company's common stock plus related expenses.
The new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of the previous
$300,000 stock repurchase program. The program allows the Company to repurchase
its common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from
time to time in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 8,341 shares of
common stock at an aggregate cost of $285,869, or an average price of $34.27 per
share, of which 1,330 shares of common stock were repurchased under the previous
$300,000 stock repurchase program. As of December 29, 2007, 77 shares have been
repurchased at an aggregate cost of $2,959 and remained
unsettled.


During
fiscal 2007, the Company retired 6,329 shares previously repurchased under the
stock repurchase programs. At December 29, 2007, the Company had $260,567
remaining under the current stock repurchase program. Subsequent to December 29,
2007, the Company repurchased 4,563 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost
of $155,350, or an average price of $34.04 per share.

During
fiscal 2006, the Company retired 5,117 shares of common stock which were
previously repurchased under the Company’s prior stock repurchase program. These
shares were repurchased during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 at an aggregate cost
of $192,339, or an average price of $37.59 per share.

12.
Income Taxes:

As a
result of the adoption of FIN 48 on December 31, 2006, the Company recorded an
increase of $2,275 to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
corresponding decrease in its balance of retained earnings. The following table
summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal
year ended December 29, 2007:
 






Balance
      at December 31, 2006


 $    16,453



 
      

Gross
      increases related to prior period tax positions


          1,279



 
      

Gross
      decreases related to prior period tax positions


        (1,853)



 
      

Gross
      increases related to current period tax positions

Settlements


           (539)



 
      

Expiration
      of statute of limitations


           (271)




Balance
      at December 29, 2007


 $    20,409




 


As of
December 29, 2007 the entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized,
would reduce the Company’s annual effective tax rate.

With the
adoption of FIN 48, the Company provides for interest and penalties as a part of
income tax expense. During fiscal 2007, the Company accrued potential penalties
and interest of $709 and $1,827, respectively, related to these unrecognized tax
benefits. As of December 29, 2007, the Company has recorded a liability for
potential penalties and interest of $1,843 and $4,421, respectively. Prior to
the adoption of FIN 48, the Company classified interest associated with tax
contingencies in interest expense. The Company has not provided for any
penalties associated with tax contingencies unless considered probable of
assessment. The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change
significantly over the next 12 months.

During
the next 12 months, it is possible the Company could conclude on $2,000 to
$3,000 of the contingencies associated with unrecognized tax uncertainties due
mainly to settlement and expiration of statute of limitations (including tax
benefits, interest and penalties).  The majority of these resolutions
would be achieved through the completion of current income tax
examinations.

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effect of temporary differences
between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
for income tax reporting purposes. Net deferred income tax balances are

income tax liabilities of $46,140 and $67,662, respectively. The deferred income
tax assets also include state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of
approximately $3,214 and $1,752, respectively. These NOLs may be used to reduce
future taxable income and expire periodically through fiscal year 2027. Due to
uncertainties related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets for NOLs
in certain jurisdictions, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of

Contingencies:

In the
case of all known contingencies, the Company accrues for an obligation,
including estimated legal costs, when it is probable and the amount is
reasonably estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known to the
Company, the Company reassesses its position with respect to accrued liabilities
and other potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to
future change include legal matters and tax matters not subject to FIN 48, which
are subject to change as events evolve, and as additional information becomes
available during the administrative and litigation process.
 
The
Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including
automobile manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers,
has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of
exposure to asbestos-containing products. The Company and some of its
subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits. The
plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured, distributed
and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. Many of the cases pending against
the Company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation. The
damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are
substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as
defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy, which will limit
plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants. Although
the Company diligently defends against these claims, the Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into
settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interests of the
Company’s shareholders. The Company believes that most of these claims are at
least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, the Company
does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s operating results, financial position or liquidity. However, if
the Company was to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and
was ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these claims
could have a material adverse affect on its operating results, financial
position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against the Company or any
of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products increases substantially, the costs associated with
concluding these claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts,
could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial
position or liquidity in future periods.

The
Company is involved in various types of legal proceedings arising from claims of
employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of
claims by current and former employees.  The damages claimed against
the Company in some of these proceedings are substantial; however, because of
the uncertainty of the outcome of such legal proceedings and because the
Company’s liability, if any, arising from such legal matters, including the size
of any damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any
negotiated settlement, could vary widely, the Company cannot reasonably estimate
the possible loss or range of loss which may arise.  The Company is
also involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the
normal course of business.  Although the final outcome of these legal
matters cannot be determined, based on the facts presently known, it is
management’s opinion that the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

2006 and December 31, 2005
(in thousands, except per share
data)


 
Prior to
December 31, 2006, the Company accrued for tax contingencies when it was
probable that a liability to a taxing authority had been incurred and the amount
of the contingency could be reasonably estimated, based on past experience.
Effective December 31, 2006, the accounting for income tax contingencies changed
with the adoption of FIN 48 as previously explained in the Company’s income tax
footnote. The Company’s tax contingency reserve at December 30, 2006 was $6,415.
It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote
that costs in excess of those reserved for will have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

The
Company has entered into employment agreements with certain team members that
provide severance pay benefits under certain circumstances, including
termination of employment of the team member by the Company. The maximum
contingent liability under these employment agreements is approximately $3,306
and $5,590 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively, of which
nothing has been accrued.

15.
Benefit Plans:

401(k)
Plan

The
Company maintains a defined contribution team member benefit plan, which covers
substantially all team members after one year of service and who have attained
the age of 21. The plan allows for team member salary deferrals, which are
matched at the Company’s discretion. Company contributions were $8,234, $7,726
and $6,779 in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005,
respectively.
 
Deferred
Compensation

The
Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain team
members. This plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the
team member’s base salary and bonus, as determined by the Retirement Plan
Committee. The Company establishes and maintains a deferred compensation
liability for this plan. At December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 these
liabilities were $4,668 and $3,402, respectively.
 
Postretirement
Plan

The
Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible
retired team members through a postretirement plan, or the Plan. These benefits
are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. The
Plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid. During
the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company amended the Plan to exclude
outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective
January 1, 2006. Due to this plan amendment, the Company's accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $7,557, resulting in an
unrecognized prior service cost in the same amount. The unrecognized prior
service cost is being amortized over the 13-year estimated remaining life
expectancy of the plan participants as allowed under SFAS No. 106, “Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”

The
following provides a reconciliation of the accrued benefit obligation included
in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,
recorded and the funded status of the plan as of December 29, 2007 and December
30, 2006:

The
health care cost trend rate was assumed to be 10.0% for 2008, 9.5% for 2009,
8.5% for 2010, 8.0% for 2011, 7.0% for 2012, 6.0% for 2013 and 5.0% to 5.5% for
2014 and thereafter. If the health care cost were increased 1% for all future
years the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased by
$214 as of December 29, 2007. The effect of this change on the combined service
and interest cost would have been an increase of $16 for 2007. If the health
care cost were decreased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation would have decreased by $195 as of December 29, 2007. The
effect of this change on the combined service and interest cost would have been
a decrease of $14 for 2007.

The
postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost
was computed using the following weighted average discount rates as determined
by the Company’s actuaries for each applicable year:

The
Company reserves the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions
at any time. The Company also continues to evaluate ways in which it can better
manage these benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions to
assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a
significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation, annual expense and
projected benefit payments.

The
Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006.
As a result, the Company recorded an actuarial gain to accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax, and recognized previously unamortized prior
service cost that had not yet been included in net periodic postretirement
benefit cost as of December 30, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no impact
on net income, but increased comprehensive income by $3,316, net of tax. The
table below shows the incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on individual
line items in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 30,
2006:

At
December 29, 2007, the net unrealized gain on the postretirement plan consists
of an unrealized gain of $5,370 related to prior service cost and an unrealized
net gain of $1,037 related to actuarial gains. Approximately $581 of the
unrealized gain related to prior service cost and $14 related to the actuarial
gain is expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic postretirement
benefit cost in fiscal 2008.

16.
Share-Based Compensation Plans:

The
Company has share-based compensation plans as allowed under its long-term
incentive plan, or LTIP. Historically, the Company has granted fixed stock
options and deferred stock units, or DSUs, to its employees under these plans.
Beginning in fiscal 2007, the Company primarily granted stock appreciation
rights, or SARs, and restricted stock, or unvested shares. The stock options and
SARs authorized to be granted are non-qualified and terminate on the seventh
anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, the stock options and SARs vest
over a three-year period in equal annual installments beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date and contain no post-vesting restrictions other
than normal trading black-out periods prescribed by the Company’s corporate
governance policies.

The
unvested shares vest at the end of a three-year period. During this period,
holders of the unvested shares are entitled to dividend and voting rights. The
unvested shares are restricted until they vest and cannot be sold by the
recipient until the restriction has lapsed at the end of the three-year
period.

In
addition to stock options, the Company grants DSUs annually to its Board of
Directors as provided for in the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Deferred Stock Unit
Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Selected Executives, or the DSU Plan. Each
DSU is equivalent to one share of common stock of the Company. The DSUs are
immediately vested upon issuance but are held on behalf of the director until he
or she ceases to be a director. The DSUs are then distributed to the director
following his or her last date of service. Additionally, the DSU Plan provides
for the

At
December 29, 2007, there are 3,766 shares currently available for future
issuance under the LTIP. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon
exercise of stock options and SARs. During fiscal 2007, the  Company’s
shareholders approved an amendment to its LTIP which authorized the addition of
3,500 shares.

Subsequent
to December 29, 2007, the Company made a series of share-based award grants to
employees, including its newly appointed CEO, other recently hired executives
and its annual grant to employees eligible to receive share-based awards under
the Company’s LTIP.  Accordingly, the Company granted 1,362 SARs to be
settled in the Company’s common stock at a weighted average conversion price of
$34.37 and 283 shares of unvested shares at a weighted average grant price of
$35.13.

The fair
value of each unvested share award is determined based on the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair value
of unvested shares granted during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 was
$38.14 per share.

As of
December 29, 2007, there was $19,519 of unrecognized compensation expense
related to all share-based awards (excluding DSUs) that is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.

DSUs

The
Company granted eight and seven DSUs in fiscal years 2007 and 2006,
respectively, at a weighted average fair value of $41.64 and $38.35,
respectively. The DSUs are awarded at a price equal to the market price of the
Company’s underlying stock on the date of the grant. For fiscal years 2007 and
2006, respectively, the Company recognized a total of $344 and $285, on a
pre-tax basis, in compensation expense related to these DSU grants.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The
Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Through 2005 all
eligible employees, or team members, could elect to have a portion of
compensation paid in the form of Company stock in lieu of cash calculated at 85%
of fair market value at the beginning or end of the quarterly purchase period
whichever was lower. Effective January 1, 2006, the ESPP was amended such that
eligible team members may purchase common stock at 95% of fair market value at
the date of purchase. There are annual limitations on team member elections of
either $25 per team member or ten percent of compensation, whichever is less.
Under the plan, team members acquired 53, 90 and 110 shares in fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 29, 2007, there were 1,408 shares
available to be issued under the plan.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank overdrafts,
accounts payable, financed vendor accounts payable and current portion of
long-term debt approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
those instruments. As of December 29, 2007, the fair value of the Company’s
long-term debt with a carrying value of $505,062 is approximately $502,000 and
is based on similar issues available to the Company as of that date. The
Company’s interest rate swaps are presented at fair value as stated in its
accounting policy on hedge activities (Note 2).


18.
Segment and Related Information:

The
Company has the following two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts, or AAP,
and AI. The AAP segment is comprised of store operations within the United
States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which operate under the trade names
“Advance Auto Parts,” “Advance Discount Auto Parts” and “Western Auto.” These
stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive
replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported
cars and light trucks, with no significant concentration in any specific product
area. 

The AI
segment consists solely of the operations of Autopart International, which
continues to operate as an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary. AI’s business
serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors and
jobbers located throughout the Northeastern region of the United States. The
Company acquired AI in September 2005.

The
Company evaluates each of its segment’s financial performance based on net sales
and operating profit for purposes of making decisions and allocating resources.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note
2.

The
following table summarizes financial information for each of the Company's
business segments for the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006, respectively.

INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT
Notes
to the Condensed Parent Company Statements
December
29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
(in
thousands, except per share data)

1.
Presentation

These
condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations,
although management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the
information presented not misleading.

2.
Organization

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. (“the Company”) is a holding company, which is the 100%
shareholder of Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
("Stores") during the periods presented. The parent/subsidiary relationship
between the Company and Stores includes certain related party transactions.
These transactions consist primarily of interest on intercompany advances,
dividends, capital contributions and allocations of certain costs. Deferred
income taxes have not been provided for financial reporting and tax basis
differences on the undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries. The Company fully
and unconditionally guarantees the term loan and revolving credit facility
of Stores. These debt agreements do not contain restrictions on the payment
of dividends, loans or advances between the Company and Stores and Stores’
subsidiaries. Therefore, there are no such restrictions as of December 29, 2007
and December 30, 2006.

3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting
Period

The
Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December, which
results in an extra week every several years (the next 53 week fiscal year is
2008).  All fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of
operations.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value as it related to other accounting pronouncements that
require or permit fair value measurements, and expands the disclosures on fair
value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued a staff position that
delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed at least annually. Except
for the delay for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods
within such years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
adopting SFAS No. 157.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS
No. 159.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations,” which
replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R, among other
things, establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any controlling interests in the acquired
entity; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information
to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination. Costs of the acquisition
will be recognized separately from the business combination. SFAS No. 141R
applies to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51.” SFAS No. 160,
among other things, provides guidance and establishes amended accounting and
reporting standards for a parent company’s noncontrolling interest in a
subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.
160 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

Date.  The Plan is a continuation of the Plan that was
originally adopted effective as of May 19, 2004.  Except as may be
expressly provided otherwise, the Plan is hereby amended and restated effective

      will be treated as continuing intact, and thus the Eligible Executive will
      not be deemed to have incurred a Separation from Service, while the
      Eligible Executive is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide
      leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed
      six months, or if longer, so long as the Eligible Executive retains a
      right to reemployment with the Affiliated Company under an applicable
      statute or by contract.  A leave of absence constitutes a bona
      fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the
      Eligible Executive will return to perform services for the Affiliated
      Company.  If the period of leave exceeds six months and the
      Eligible Executive does not retain a right to reemployment under an
      applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed
      to terminate on the first day immediately following such six-month
      period.




 




(d)  


Whether
      a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether
      the facts and circumstances indicate that the Affiliated Company and the
      Eligible Executive reasonably anticipated that no further services would
      be performed after a certain date, or that the level of bona fide services
      the Eligible Executive would perform after such date (whether as an
      Employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no
      more than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services
      performed  (whether as an Employee or an independent contractor)
      over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of
      services to the Affiliated Companies if the Eligible Executive has been
      providing services to the Affiliated Companies less than 36
      months).  An Eligible Executive is presumed to have incurred a
      Separation from Service where the level of bona fide services performed
      decreases to a level equal to 20 percent or less of the average level of
      services performed by the Eligible Executive during the immediately
      preceding 36-month period.  An Eligible Executive will be
      presumed not to have incurred a Separation from Service where the level of
      bona fide services performed continues at a level that is 50 percent or
      more of the average level of service performed by the Eligible Executive
      during the immediately preceding 36-month period.  No
      presumption applies to a decrease in the level of bona fide services
      performed to a level that is more than 20 percent, and less than 50
      percent, of the average level of bona fide services performed during the
      immediately preceding 36-month
period.

PARTICIPATION
AND DEFERRAL ELECTIONS
 
Section
3.1  Eligibility.
 




(a)  


Each
      Director and Eligible Executive who was a Participant in the Plan as of
      December 31, 2007 shall continue as such, subject to the provisions
      of the Plan.




 




(b)  


On
      or after January 1, 2008, each individual who becomes a Director or
      an Eligible Executive shall be immediately eligible to become a
      Participant in the Plan.




 




(c)  


An
      Eligible Executive who is transferred from an Employer to employment with
      an Affiliated Company that is not an Employer with respect to the Plan, or
      who while continuing in the employ of an Employer ceases to be an Eligible
      Executive (a “Transferred Participant”), shall not be considered to have
      incurred a Separation from Service.  The Transferred Participant
      shall continue to be eligible to make deferrals under the Plan through the
      end of the Plan Year in which such transfer occurs, or for such additional
      period as may be permitted by the Compensation
  Committee.




 
Section
3.2  Duration
of Participation.  Each Participant shall remain a Participant
under the Plan until the balance of all of the Participant’s DSU Accounts has
been distributed to the Participant or the Participant’s
Beneficiary.
 
Section
3.3  Deferral
Election Agreement.
 




(a)  


For
      each Board Service Period, each Director shall be permitted to submit a
      Deferral Election Agreement with respect to the Retainer otherwise payable
      to the Director for services performed during the Board Service
      Period.




 




(b)  


For
      each Plan Year, each Eligible Executive for that Plan Year shall be
      permitted to submit a separate Deferral Election Agreement with respect to
      each of the forms of Eligible Compensation otherwise payable to the
      Eligible Executive for services performed during the Plan
      Year.  The forms of Eligible Compensation for a Plan Year
      consist of Base Salary, Quarterly Bonuses and Roll-up Performance
      Bonus.  For administrative convenience, the Plan Administration
      Committee can direct that the elections for two or more forms of the
      Eligible Compensation be combined on a single form.  The
      submission of the Deferral Election Agreement must be made in accordance
      with such policies and procedures established by the Plan Administration
      Committee and communicated to Eligible Individuals, which procedures may
      permit or require elections to be made by electronic
  media.




 




(c)  


The
      Deferral Election Agreement with respect to each form of Eligible
      Compensation shall include the elections and descriptions prescribed
      below.

(i)  


The
      amount of the Participant’s Eligible Compensation to be deferred for the
      Board Service Period or Plan Year, as applicable
      (i.e., the “Deferred Amount,” as described more fully in
      Section 3.4);




 




(ii)  


The
      designated payment event for such Deferred Amount, as described more fully
      in Section 3.5; and




 




(iii)  


The
      form in which the Deferred Amount is elected to be paid, as described more
      fully in Section 3.6.




 
Section
3.4  Deferred
Amount.
 




 
      


(a)


The
      Deferral Election Agreement of a Participant for a Board Service Period or
      Plan Year, as applicable, shall designate the amount of each form of the
      Eligible Compensation for the period that the Participant elects to have
      deferred under the Plan (the “Deferred
  Amount”).




 




 
      


(i)


A
      Director may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her Retainer for a Board
      Service Period.




 




 
      


(ii)


An
      Eligible Executive shall make a separate deferral election for each form
      of the Eligible Executive’s Eligible Compensation (i.e., Base Salary,
      Quarterly Bonus and Roll-up Performance Bonus) for the Plan
      Year.  The maximum or minimum amount of deferral that may be
      elected by an Eligible Executive for a Plan Year with respect to each form
      of Eligible Compensation shall be established by the Plan Administration
      Committee.




 




 
      


(b)


The
      aspect of a Deferral Election Agreement regarding the elected Deferred
      Amount shall not apply to any pay period for which the amount of the
      Eligible Compensation remaining to be paid to the Participant (but for the
      deferral election), after making any other deductions or withholdings of
      income, would be less than the Deferred Amount prescribed in the Deferral
      Election Agreement.




 
Section
3.5  Designated
Payment Event.  A Participant’s Deferral Election Agreement
must designate the event that will give rise to the payment of the Deferred
Amount.  The period of the deferral through the date of the event
giving rise to the payment of the Deferred Amount is sometimes referred to
herein as the “Deferral Period.”  Subject to the terms of the Plan,
including Section 5.6 (regarding the restriction on distributions to
Specified Employees), a Participant may elect to have the Deferred Amount
pertaining to services performed in any Board Service Period or Plan Year, as
applicable, become payable upon either of the following alternative
events:

 




 
      


(a)


 
The
      Participant’s Retirement or other Separation from Service;
      or






 




 
      


(b)


 
The
      last day of a future calendar year; provided, however, that such
      designated calendar year cannot be earlier than the second calendar year
      following the calendar year in which falls the first day of the Board
      Service Period or Plan Year, as applicable, to which the deferred
      compensation pertains (i.e., as of a “Specified
      Time”).  For example, a Director may elect the designated
      payment event for a DSU Account pertaining to the Board

Service
      Period beginning as of the annual Board meeting held in May of Year 1 to
      be December 31 of Year 3, or the last day of any subsequent calendar
      year.






 

Notwithstanding
the terms of a Deferral Election Agreement, a Participant’s Retirement shall be
a designated payment event with respect to each of the Participant’s DSU
Accounts.  Accordingly, if such Retirement occurs prior to the
occurrence of the Specified Time designated in any Deferral Election Agreement
for any DSU Account, then the Retirement shall supplant the Specified Time
election with respect to that  DSU Account.
 
Section
3.6  Form of
Payment.  A Participant’s Deferral Election Agreement shall
designate the form in which the Deferred Amount will be paid if such payments
arise by reason of a designated payment event prescribed in Section 3.5
above.  The permissive forms of payment are:
 




 
      


(a)


A
      lump sum; or




 




 
      


(b)


Substantially
      equal annual installments over a period (as the Participant shall
      designate) of not less than two years and not more than
      10 years.




 
Section 3.7  Deferral
Election Deadline.
 






(a)  


A
      Deferral Election pertaining to a Director’s Retainer that may otherwise
      become payable to the Director for services performed to the Board during
      a Board Service Period must be filed on or before December 31 of the
      Plan Year immediately preceding the beginning of the Board Service Period
      for which it is effective (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such
      earlier submission date established by the Plan Administration
      Committee.




 






(b)  


A
      Deferral Election pertaining to any Base Salary or Quarterly Bonuses that
      may otherwise become payable to an Eligible Executive for services
      performed during a Plan Year, including in regard to the fourth quarter
      Quarterly Bonus for a Plan Year that will be paid after the end of that
      Plan Year, must be submitted on or before December 31 of the Plan
      Year immediately preceding the Plan Year for which it is effective
      (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier submission date
      established by the Plan Administration
  Committee.




 






(c)  


A
      Deferral Election pertaining to any Roll-up Performance Bonus that may
      otherwise become payable to an Eligible Executive for services performed
      during a Plan Year must be submitted on or before December 31 of the
      Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year performance period for which
      it is effective (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier
      submission date established by the Plan Administration
      Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation
      Committee in its discretion may permit Eligible Executives to submit the
      Deferral Election for the Roll-up Performance Bonus pertaining to any Plan
      Year on or before June 30 falling within the applicable Plan Year
      (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier submission date
      established by the Plan Administration Committee, subject to the following
      conditions:




 






(i)  


The
      Eligible Executive must have performed services for the Employer
      continuously during the period beginning on the later of the beginning of
      the performance period or the date the applicable performance criteria are
      established, and ending on the date the election is made;
    and




 


 


10





 


 






(ii)  


The
      election is made before the amount of the Roll-up Performance Bonus
      becomes readily ascertainable.




 
Section
3.8  Election
for First Year of Eligibility.  Notwithstanding Section 3.7
above, the provisions of this Section 3.8 shall apply in regard to an individual
who becomes an Eligible Executive or a Director, and thereupon becomes eligible
to participate in the Plan, after the first day of a Plan Year.
 




(a)  


The
      timing of the Eligible Individual’s initial Deferral Election shall be
      governed by the rules prescribed
below.




 






(i)  


The
      initial Deferral Election must be made within 30 days after the date
      the individual becomes such an Eligible Individual.  Except as
      provided in paragraph (ii) below, the Eligible Individual’s initial
      Deferral Election, or the decision to not make an initial Deferral
      Election, shall become irrevocable as of the expiration of such 30-day
      election period.




 






(ii)  


Notwithstanding
      paragraph (i) above, an initial Deferral Election by an Eligible
      Executive with respect to a Quarterly Bonus or a Roll-up Performance Bonus
      that is affirmatively made and submitted under the Plan by the last day of
      the quarter or Plan Year preceding the quarter or Plan Year for which the
      Deferral Election will first apply, and before the expiration of the
      otherwise applicable 30-day election period, shall become irrevocable as
      of the last day of such preceding quarter or Plan
  Year.




 






(iii)  


In
      no event may the deadline for making an initial Deferral Election under
      this Plan with respect to any Eligible Individual for any Plan Year be
      subsequent to the deadline imposed on that Eligible Individual for making
      a Deferral Election for such Plan Year under any other Aggregated
      Plan.




 




(b)  


A
      former Participant who has again become an Eligible Individual shall be
      treated as first becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, and thus
      shall be subject to the special election rules of this Section 3.8,
      under either of the following
circumstances:




 






(i)  


The
      former Participant has been paid all amounts deferred under the Plan and
      all other Aggregated Plans, and the Participant ceased to be eligible to
      elect to continue to participate in the Plan or an Aggregated Plan on or
      before the date of the last such payment;
or




 






(ii)  


The
      former Participant was not eligible to participate in the Plan or an
      Aggregated Plan during the 24-month period ending on the date of again
      becoming eligible to participate in the Plan or an Aggregated
      Plan.




 




(c)  


The
      compensation to which such initial Deferral Election will apply shall be
      determined in accordance with the rules set forth
  below.




 






(i)  


The
      Eligible Individual’s initial Deferral Election shall apply only to the
      Eligible Compensation otherwise payable for services performed by the
      Eligible Individual 




 


 


11





 



 






  


subsequent
      to the date the Deferral Election has become irrevocable pursuant to
      subsection (a) above.




 







(ii)  


For
      purposes of paragraph (i) above, as with respect to a Deferral
      Election by an Eligible Executive pertaining to a Quarterly or Roll-up
      Performance Bonus, if the initial Deferral Election is made after the
      beginning of the applicable bonus performance period, the Deferral
      Election shall apply to the total amount of Eligible Compensation for the
      applicable performance period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
      which is the number of days remaining in the performance period after the
      election has become irrevocable, and the denominator of which is the total
      number of days in the performance
period.




 






(iii)  


The
      formula prescribed in paragraph (ii) above shall also apply in regard
      to a Deferral Election pertaining to the deferral of the Eligible
      Executive’s Base Salary or to a Director’s Retainer, unless the amount of
      the individual’s Eligible Compensation for the portion of a period prior
      to the date of the irrevocability of the Deferral Election (i.e., the
      amount of the Eligible Compensation that is not eligible to be deferred
      under the Plan) can be readily
ascertained.




 
Section
3.9  Irrevocability
of Election. 
 




(a)  


Once
      the applicable Statutory Deadline to make a Deferral Election for any form
      of Eligible Compensation with respect to any Board Service Period or Plan
      Year, as applicable, has passed, as prescribed in Section 3.7, or once the
      deadline for making an initial Deferral Election pursuant to Section 3.8
      above has expired, the Deferral Election shall generally become
      irrevocable.  The consequences of such include the
      following:




 






(i)  


The
      amount of the Eligible Compensation that the Participant elected to defer
      for the Board Service Period or Plan Year, as applicable, or the election
      not to defer any amount, cannot be canceled or
  modified;




 






(ii)  


The
      form of payment for the DSU Account to which the Deferred Election applies
      cannot be modified; and




 






(iii)  


The
      designated date of payment for the DSU Account to which the Deferred
      Election applies cannot be modified, except as provided in
      Section 5.8.




 




(b)  


Notwithstanding
      subsection (a) above, an Eligible Executive who receives a hardship
      withdrawal from a Section 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or
      another Affiliated Company, and who is thereupon suspended from making
      elective deferrals under all qualified and non-qualified plans of the
      Affiliated Companies pursuant to IRS Regulation § 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)
      and the terms of the 401(k) plan, shall have his or her Deferral Election
      under this Plan thereupon canceled on a prospective basis.  Such
      Deferral Election cancellation rule shall be subject to the
      following:




 






(i)  


An
      Eligible Executive’s Deferral Election shall not be canceled upon the
      hardship withdrawal if the 401(k) plan does not require the suspension of
      elective deferrals; and




 


 


12





 


 






(ii)  


An
      Eligible Executive whose Deferral Election is canceled pursuant to the
      above, and who thereafter becomes eligible to resume making deferrals
      under this Plan, shall nevertheless remain subject to the general election
      deadline rules prescribed under this
      Section 3.9.  Accordingly, the Eligible Executive shall not
      be permitted to resume making elective deferrals under this Plan for any
      period prior to the first day of the Plan Year following the expiration of
      the elective deferral suspension period under the applicable 401(k)
      plan.




 




(c)  


Further
      notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Deferral Election of a
      Participant who receives an Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal from the
      Plan pursuant to Section 5.11 shall be cancelled on a prospective
      basis.  Such cancellation shall continue in effect for the
      remainder of the Plan Year in which the withdrawal is made.  The
      Participant, if otherwise so eligible, shall be permitted to elect to make
      elective deferrals under the Plan for the subsequent Plan
      Year.




 
Section
3.10  Evergreen
Elections.
 




(a)  


Prior
      to each Deferral Election Agreement submission deadline, each Eligible
      Individual shall be provided information regarding the Eligible
      Individual’s deferral rights under the Plan for the following Plan Year or
      other applicable period.  The Eligible Individual shall then be
      permitted to affirmatively elect or decline to enter into a Deferral
      Election Agreement for the applicable period.  In the event that
      an Eligible Individual fails to timely submit a Deferral Election
      Agreement, or fails to affirmatively decline to enter into a Deferral
      Election Agreement, for any period, then the Eligible Individual shall be
      deemed to have made the same Deferral Election (or election declination)
      as had most recently been made for the form of Eligible Compensation at
      issue.




 




(b)  


Subject
      to Section 3.9(b) above (regarding the cancellation of a Deferred
      Election upon a 401(k) plan hardship withdrawal), a deemed election shall
      become irrevocable as of the applicable Statutory Deadline (as prescribed
      in Section 3.7).  For example, an Eligible Executive who
      fails to make or affirmatively decline a Deferral Election Agreement in
      regard to Base Salary payable for Year 2 will be deemed to have made
      the same Base Salary Deferral Election, or election declination, as in
      effect for Year 1.  An Eligible Individual who is first
      eligible to make a Deferral Election for any form of Eligible
      Compensation, but fails to timely make such election, shall be deemed to
      have declined such Deferral Election.  Subject to
      subsection (c) below, this deemed evergreen election shall apply to
      all aspects of an Eligible Individual’s Deferral Election, including in
      regard to the designated Deferral
Period.




 




(c)  


The
      Deferral Period applicable to a evergreen election deemed to be made under
      this Section 3.10 with respect to any form of Eligible Compensation
      shall be determined as prescribed
below.




 






(i)  


If
      the most recent Deferral Election for the form of Eligible Compensation at
      issue designated a Deferral Period extending to the Eligible Individual’s
      Retirement or other Separation from Service, then that same designation
      shall apply to the deemed evergreen
election.




 


 


13





 


 






(ii)  


If
      the most recent Deferral Election for the form of Eligible Compensation
      designated a deferral of payment for a Specified Time, then that Specified
      Time shall be deemed to have also been elected; provided, however, if that
      Specified Time is not the end of at least two full calendar years
      following the beginning of the Board Service Period or Plan Year, as
      applicable, to which the deemed evergreen election applies, then the
      Deferral Period for a Deferred Amount that is the subject of the deemed
      election shall be the end of such second future calendar
    year.




 
Section
3.11  Non-Elective
LTIP Shares Grant Deferrals.
 




(a)  


Each
      Shares Grant awarded to a Director under the 2004 LTIP shall be
      automatically deferred under the Plan on a non-elective basis, and shall
      be credited to the Director’s DSU
Account.





 




(b)  


 
A
      Director who receives a Shares Grant for any Board Service Period shall be
      deemed to have made the same election as to the timing and form of payment
      of the DSU Account to which the Shares Grant is credited as the election
      that was made (or which was deemed to have been made pursuant to
      Section 3.10 above) in connection with the deferral of the Director’s
      Retainer for such Board Service Period.  In the event the
      Director did not make (and is not deemed to have made) a Deferral Election
      for such Board Service Period, then the Director shall be deemed to have
      elected to have the balance of the DSU Account pertaining to such Shares
      Grant paid in a lump sum upon
  Retirement.

AND INVESTMENT OF ACCOUNTS
 
 
Section
4.1  DSU
Accounts.
 




(a)  


Separate
      DSU Accounts shall be maintained for each Participant.  An
      amount equal to that the Eligible Compensation deferred by or on behalf of
      the Participant under the Plan shall be credited to the applicable DSU
      Accounts.  More than one DSU Account may be maintained for a
      Participant as necessary to reflect separate Deferral Election Agreements
      specifying different Deferral Periods or forms of
  payment.




 




(b)  


A
      Participant’s DSU Accounts shall be utilized solely as a device for the
      measurement and determination of the amounts to be paid to the Participant
      pursuant to this Plan, and shall not constitute or be treated as a trust
      fund of any kind.




 




(c)  


A
      DSU Account will be credited with the number of DSUs calculated to the
      nearest thousandth of a DSU, determined by dividing the Deferred Amount on
      the date of deferral by the closing market price of the Company’s common
      stock as reported on the Consolidated Tape of the New York Stock Exchange
      listed shares on such date of
deferral.




 
Section
4.2  Dividend
Equivalent Credits.  To the extent the Company pays dividends,
on each dividend payment date, a Participant’s DSU Account will be credited with
Dividend Equivalents in additional DSUs determined by multiplying the number of
DSUs in the Participant’s DSU Account on the related dividend record date by any
per share cash dividends declared by the Company on its own common stock and
dividing the product by the closing market price of the Company’s common stock
as reported on the Consolidated Tape of the New York Stock Exchange listed
shares on such dividend payment date.  At the Compensation Committee’s
discretion, the DSU Accounts may also be credited with DSUs by multiplying the
number of DSUs in a Participant’s DSU Account by any stock dividends declared by
the Company on its common stock, unless the DSU Accounts are adjusted pursuant
to Section 4.3
 
Section
4.3  Capital
Adjustments.  The number of DSUs in a Participant’s DSU Account
shall be adjusted, as the Board or Compensation Committee deems appropriate, to
reflect stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications, spinoffs, and other
extraordinary distributions, as if those DSUs were actual Shares.
 
Section
4.4  Vesting.  A
Participant shall be 100% vested in the balance of each of his or her DSU
Accounts at all times.
 
Section
4.5  Statement
of Accounts.  The Plan Administration Committee shall submit to
each Participant quarterly statements of his or her DSU Accounts, in such form
as the Plan Administration Committee deems desirable, setting forth the balance
to the credit of such Participant in his or her DSU Accounts as of the end of
the most recently completed quarter.

Section
4.6  Hypothetical
Nature of Accounts and Investments.  Each DSU Account
established under this Article IV shall be maintained for bookkeeping
purposes only.  Neither the Plan nor any of the DSU Accounts
established under the Plan shall hold any actual funds or assets.  The
DSU Accounts established hereunder shall be used solely to determine the amounts
to be paid hereunder, shall not be or represent an equity security of the
Company, shall not be convertible into or otherwise entitle a Participant to
acquire an equity security of the Company and shall not carry any voting
rights.

Participant:
 




(a)  


The
      Participant’s Separation from Service.  In this regard, a
      distribution by reason of a Participant’s Retirement shall be permitted
      only if the Retirement constitutes a Separation from
    Service;




 




(b)  


The
      Participant becoming Disabled;




 




(c)  


The
      Participant’s death;




 




(d)  


A
      Specified Time, as prescribed under the Participant’s Deferral Election
      Agreement;




 




(e)  


An
      Unforeseeable Emergency, as prescribed in Section 5.11 below;
      or




 




(f)  


The
      termination of the Plan, or portion of the Plan, prescribed in
      Section 9.2.




 
Section
5.2  Retirement
Distributions.  Subject to Section 5.6 below, in either of
the circumstances described below, upon a Participant’s Retirement, the value of
the Participant’s DSU Accounts shall be then distributed to the Participant in
installments or in a lump sum as designated in the applicable Deferral Election
Agreement.
 




(a)  


The  Participant
      had elected to receive payment of a DSU Account upon Retirement;
      or




 




(b)  


The
      Deferral Period elected by the Participant for that DSU Account was a
      Specified Time, but the Participant Retires before the end of that
      Specified Time.




 
Section
5.3  Specified
Time Distributions.  Subject to Sections 5.6 and 5.8
below, if the Deferral Period elected by a Participant with respect to a DSU
Account is a Specified Time, and the Participant did not Retire before the end
of that Specified Time, then upon the end of that Specified Time, the value of
the DSU Account at issue shall be distributed to the Participant in installments
or in a lump sum as designated in the applicable Deferral Election
Agreement.
 
Section
5.4  Other
Payment Events.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any Deferral
Election Agreement, if prior to Retirement a Participant dies, becomes Disabled
but remains employed, or incurs a Separation from Service, the entire balance of
all of the Participant’s DSU Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant or
the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (as the case may be) in a lump
sum payment.
 
Section
5.5  Designated
Payment Date.
 




(a)  


The
      designated date as of which the value of a Participant’s DSU Account is to
      be distributed, or shall commence being distributed, shall be as
      prescribed below.




 
 


 


17





 






(i)  


The
      designated payment date with respect to a DSU Account to be distributed in
      a lump sum payment, including with respect to a lump sum payment made to a
      Participant’s Beneficiary upon the Participant’s death, shall be the first
      day following the date of the event giving rise to the lump sum payment
      (or, if later, the date as of which the final deferral with respect to the
      Deferral Election Agreement pertaining to the DSU Account is withheld from
      the Participant’s paycheck).




 




(ii)  


In
      the case of distributions to be made to a Participant in the form of
      installment payments, the designated payment dates shall be the
      first day of the month following the date of the event that gives
      rise to the payment, and each annual anniversary of that initial
      designated payment date.




 




(iii)  


The
      designated payment date with respect to amounts in a Director’s DSU
      Account that are attributable to deferrals of Shares Grants shall be paid
      to the Director in a lump sum within 90 days after the date of the
      Director’s Separation from Service of the
Board.




 




(iv)  


The
      designated payment date with respect to a withdrawal due to an
      Unforeseeable Emergency pursuant to Section 5.9 below shall be the
      date as of which the withdrawal request is approved by the Plan
      Administration Committee.




 




(b)  


For
      purposes of the administrative provisions of this Plan, a payment shall be
      treated as having been made upon the date specified under
      subsection (a) above if the payment is
  made:




 




(i)  


On
      such date or a later date within the same calendar year;
  or




 




(ii)  


If
      later, by the 15th
      day of the third calendar month following the date so
      specified.




 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if calculation of the amount of the payment is not
administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Participant
(or the Participant’s estate), the payment will be treated as made upon the
specified date if the payment is made during the first calendar year in which
the payment is administratively practicable.
 
For
purposes of administrative convenience, payment may be made to a Participant no
earlier than 30 days before the designated payment date prescribed in subsection
(a) above.
 
In
no event shall a Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate
the taxable year of the distribution.
 
Section
5.6  Restriction
on Distributions to Specified Employees.
 




(a)  


Notwithstanding
      the provisions of Section 5.5 above, if a Participant is a Specified
      Employee as of the date of the Participant’s Retirement or other
      Separation from Service, then, by reason of such event, the amounts held
      in the Participant’s DSU Accounts shall become payable as of the
      first day of the seventh month following the date of the
      




 


 


18





 



 




  


 Participant’s
      Retirement or other Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as of the
      date of the Participant’s death).




 





(b)  


If
      the distributions to the Specified Employee are to be made in annual
      installments, the delay in payment prescribed in subsection (a)(ii)
      above shall apply solely to the first installment payment.  Each
      subsequent installment payment shall be made as of the date such payment
      otherwise would have been made pursuant to
    Section 5.5.




 




(c)  


The
      distribution restrictions prescribed in subsection (a)(ii) above
      shall not apply to a payment to be made pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i)
      or (ii) (regarding the payment of employment taxes and compensation
      deferred under the Plan or a certificate of divesture compliance
      distributions), or Section 10.2(b) (regarding domestic relations
      orders).




 
Section
5.7  No
Acceleration of Scheduled Distributions.
 




(a)  


Except
      as otherwise provided in the Plan, the time or schedule of any
      distribution of any portion of a Participant’s DSU Accounts shall not be
      permitted to be accelerated, either at the election of the Participant or
      at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Plan Administration
      Committee.





 




(b)  


 
Notwithstanding
      the foregoing, distributions may be made to or on behalf of a Participant
      prior to the otherwise applicable designated payment date in the following
      situations:





 





(i)  


As
      may be necessary to comply with a certificate of divestiture (as defined
      in Code Section 1043(b)(2));




 




(ii)  


To
      pay FICA taxes on amounts deferred under the Plan, or income taxes on
      additional charges arising from the Employer’s payment of FICA taxes or
      for amounts attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes;
      or




 




(iii)  


If
      the Plan at any time fails to meet the requirements of Code
      Section 409A and the underlying regulations.  In that
      event, however, the accelerated payment may not exceed the amount required
      to be included in the Participant’s income as a result of the Plan’s
      failure to comply with the Code Section 409A
      requirements.




 
Section
5.8  Extension
of Specified Time Deferral Period.  Section 3.5(b) of the
Plan permits a Participant to select a Deferral Period of a stated period of
calendar years (i.e., a “Specified Time Deferral Period”).  In
this connection, a Participant shall be permitted to extend a Specified Time
Deferral Period with respect to a DSU Account, subject to the conditions set
forth below.
 




(a)  


An
      election to extend the Specified Time Deferral Period with respect to any
      DSU Account must be submitted under the Plan in accordance with the Plan
      Administration Committee’s established
  procedures.




 




(b)  


Any
      such election shall not take effect under the Plan until 12 months
      after the date on which the election is properly
  submitted.




 


 


19





 


 




(c)  


An
      election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must provide for the
      lengthening of the Specified Time Deferral Period for a period of not less
      than an additional five years.




 




(d)  


Any
      election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must be made at least
      12 months prior to the designated payment date (as prescribed in
      Section 5.5(a)) for the first scheduled payment from the applicable
      DSU Account.




 




(e)  


For
      purposes of this Section 5.8:




 




(i)  


The
      entitlement to installment payments shall be treated as the entitlement to
      a single payment; and




 




(ii)  


The
      applicable designated payment date otherwise applicable to a Specified
      Time Deferral Period shall be determined without regard to the
      restrictions on distributions to Specified Employees prescribed in
      Section 5.6.




 
Section
5.9  Delay of
Payments Under Certain Circumstances.  Notwithstanding any
provision of the Plan to the contrary, payment to a Participant will be delayed
to a date after the designated payment date otherwise prescribed under
Section 5.5 under any of the circumstances prescribed below.
 




(a)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee
      reasonably anticipates that the Company’s or other Affiliated Company’s
      income tax deduction with respect to such payment otherwise would be
      limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m);
      provided, however, that in such event, the payment shall be made either at
      the earliest date at which the Compensation Committee reasonably
      anticipates that the deduction of the payment of the amount will not be
      limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m), or the
      calendar year in which the Participant Separates from
    Service.




 




(b)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee
      reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal
      securities laws or other applicable law; provided, however, that in such
      event, the payment to be made at the earliest date at which the Company or
      other Affiliated Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the
      payment will not cause such violation.  For purposes of this
      subsection (c), the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in
      gross income or other application of any penalty provision or other
      provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable
      law.




 




(c)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed upon such other events and
      conditions as may be prescribed in generally applicable guidance issued by
      the Internal Revenue Service.




 
Section
5.10  Payment
Medium.
 




(a)  


All
      payments to a Participant (or to a Participant’s Beneficiary) with respect
      to the Participant’s DSU Account shall be paid in Shares, unless the
      Compensation Committee in its discretion directs that such amounts be paid
      in cash.  If Shares are not traded on The New York Stock
      Exchange on any day on which a payment of Shares is to be made under the
      Plan, then that payment shall be made on the next day on which Shares are
      traded on





 


 


20





 


 




  


the
      New York Stock Exchange.  Shares paid from this Plan will be
      drawn from shareholder-approved stock incentive
  plans.




 





(b)  


The
      value of any fractional Shares otherwise payable with respect to a
      Participant shall be paid in cash.  Such value shall be
      determined as of the last business day of the month immediately preceding
      the date of the payment or final payment, as the case may
    be.




 
Section
5.11  Unforeseeable
Emergency Withdrawal.  A Participant who incurs an
Unforeseeable Emergency (as defined below) may submit a request to the Plan
Administration Committee for a withdrawal equal to that portion (or all) of the
Participant’s DSU Accounts as is then needed to alleviate the financial hardship
resulting therefrom.  Such withdrawals shall be subject to the
following provisions of this Section 5.11.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Section 5.11:




 




(i)  


An
      “Unforeseeable Emergency” means a severe financial hardship to a
      Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, or
      of the spouse, a dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)) or a
      primary beneficiary (as defined below) of the Participant; the loss of the
      Participant’s property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and
      unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the
      control of the Participant; and




 




(ii)  


A
      ”primary beneficiary” of a Participant is an individual who is named as a
      Beneficiary of the Participant under the Plan, and who has an
      unconditional right to all, or a portion of, the balance of the
      Participant’s DSU Account upon the death of the
    Participant.




 




(b)  


The
      circumstances that will constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency will depend
      upon the facts of each case.  Examples of circumstances that may
      qualify as an Unforeseeable Emergency (provided that the other conditions
      of this Section 5.11 are satisfied)
are:




 




(i)  


The
      imminent foreclosure of, or eviction from, the Participant’s primary
      residence;




 




(ii)  


The
      need to pay for medical expenses, including non-refundable deductibles or
      the cost of prescription drugs; and




 




(iii)  


The
      need to pay for the funeral expenses of the spouse, or dependent or
      primary beneficiary of the
Participant.




 
The
purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not Unforeseeable
Emergencies for purposes of this Plan.
 




(c)  


A
      withdrawal shall not be permitted under this Section 5.11 to the extent
      that the hardship resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency is, or may
      be, relieved:




 




(i)  


Through
      the reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
    otherwise;




 


 


21





 


 




(ii)  


By
      the liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation
      of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship;
      or




 




(iii)  


By
      the cessation of deferrals under the
Plan.




 




(d)  


The
      amount of any Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal shall be limited to that
      which the Plan Administration Committee determines is reasonably necessary
      to alleviate the hardship resulting from the occurrence of the
      Unforeseeable Emergency (which may include any amount necessary to pay any
      federal or state income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to
      result from the distribution).  The determination of the amount
      reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need must take into account
      any additional compensation that is available to the Participant upon
      cancellation of the Participant’s deferral election due to the
      Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal that is effected pursuant to Section
      3.9(c).  However, such determination is not required to take
      into account any additional Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal that is
      available under another nonqualified deferred compensation plan, but which
      has not actually been paid from that other
plan.




 




(e)  


After
      reviewing each Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal request, the Plan
      Administration Committee shall make a determination as to whether the
      circumstances satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency standards prescribed
      above, and will thereupon notify the requesting Participant of the
      determination.  If the request is approved, the Plan
      Administration Committee shall process payment of the
      withdrawal




 




(f)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee may establish a policy and procedures
      regarding the order in which Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawals are to be
      charged against the particular DSU Accounts of a
    Participant.




 
Section
5.12  Withholding
of Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, an Employer
shall withhold from payments made hereunder any amounts required to be so
withheld by any applicable law or regulation.
 
Section
5.13  USERRA
Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Article V to the
contrary, the Plan shall permit a Participant to elect a change in the time or
the form of payment as may be required to comply with the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).

ARTICLE
VI
 
PLAN
TERMINATION PAYMENTS UPON QUALIFIED CHANGE IN CONTROL EVENT
 
 
Section
6.1  Termination
of Plan Upon Change in Control.  Notwithstanding any provision
of the Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Qualified Change in
Control Event involving the Company or other Relevant Employer (as defined in
Section 6.6(a) below), the Board as constituted immediately prior to the
event may in its discretion terminate the Plan, or the portion of the Plan
pertaining to the Relevant Employer, and cause to be distributed to each
affected Participant the entire balance of all of the Participant’s DSU
Accounts.  The termination by such Board must occur within the
30 days preceding, or within the 12-month period following, the Qualified
Change in Control Event.  Such Plan termination distributions shall be
permitted only if:
 




(a)  


All
      substantially similar non-qualified deferred compensation programs
      maintained by the Company and all other Affiliated Companies are
      terminated upon such Qualified Change in Control Event;
  and




 




(b)  


All
      compensation deferred and held under each such deferred compensation
      program is distributed to Participants within 12 months of the date
      of termination of the applicable
program.




 
Section
6.2  Qualified
Change in Control Event.  For purposes of this Article VI,
a “Qualified Change in Control Event” with respect to any Participant means any
of the following events:
 




(a)  


A
      Qualified change in the ownership of a corporation that is a Relevant
      Employer (as prescribed in
Section 6.3);




 




(b)  


A
      Qualified change in effective control of a corporation that is a Relevant
      Employer (as prescribed in Section 6.4);
  and




 




(c)  


A
      Qualified Change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets
      of a corporation that is a Relevant Employer (as prescribed in
      Section 6.5).




 
Section
6.3  Change
in the Ownership of a Corporation.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the ownership of a
      corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one
      person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the corporation
      that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more
      than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power
      of the stock of such corporation.  If any one person, or more
      than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than
      50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of
      the stock of a corporation, the acquisition of additional stock by the
      same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the
      ownership of the corporation (or to cause a change in the effective
      control of the corporation within the meaning of Section 6.4
      below).




 


 


23





 


 




(b)  


For
      purposes of this Section 6.3, an increase in the percentage of stock
      owned by any one person, or by persons acting as a group, as a result of a
      transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchange for
      property will be treated as an acquisition of
  stock.




 




 
      


(c)


In
      all regards, for purposes of this Section 6.3, a change in the
      ownership of a corporation will be deemed to have occurred only when there
      is a transfer of stock of a corporation (or issuance of stock of a
      corporation), and stock in such corporation remains outstanding after the
      transaction.




 
Section
6.4  Change
in the Effective Control of a Corporation.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the effective control of a
      corporation occurs on the date that
either:




 




(i)  


A
      majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any 12-month
      period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a
      majority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the
      appointment or election; or




 




(ii)  


Any
      one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has
      acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
      acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the
      applicable corporation possessing 30 percent or more of the total
      voting power of the stock of such
corporation.




 




(b)  


A
      change in effective control of a corporation may also occur in any
      transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the
      transaction incurs a change in control event described under
      Section 6.3 or 6.5.





 
Section
6.5  Change
in the Ownership of Substantial Portion of Assets

 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the ownership of a
      substantial portion of a corporation's assets occurs on the date that any
      one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has
      acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
      acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the corporation that
      have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent
      of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the
      corporation immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For
      this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the
      corporation, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined
      without regard to any liabilities associated with such
    assets.




 




(b)  


A
      transfer of assets by a corporation shall not be treated as a change in
      the ownership of such assets, and such transfer shall thus not constitute
      a Qualified Change in Control Event, if the assets are transferred
      to:




 




(i)  


A
      shareholder of the corporation (immediately before the asset transfer) in
      exchange for or with respect to its
stock;




 


 


24





 


 




(ii)  


An
      entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of
      which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
  corporation;




 




(iii)  


A
      person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or
      indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of
      all the outstanding stock of the corporation;
or




 




(iv)  


An
      entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of
      which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in
      paragraph (iii).




 




(c)  


For
      purposes of subsection (b) above, a person's status is determined
      immediately after the transfer of the assets.  Thus, for
      example, a transfer to a corporation in which the transferor corporation
      has no ownership interest before the transaction, but which is a
      majority-owned subsidiary of the transferor corporation after the
      transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of
      the transferor corporation.




 
Section
6.6  Definitions
and Operating Rules.  The following definitions and operating
rules shall apply for purposes of this Article VI.
 




(i)  


Relevant
      Employer.  To constitute a Qualified Change in Control
      Event as to the particular Participant, the event must relate to one of
      the following corporate
  employers:




 




(i)  


The
      Company;




 




(ii)  


A
      subsidiary corporate Employer for whom the Participant is performing
      services at the time of the Qualified Change in Control Event;
      or




 




(iii)  


A
      subsidiary corporate Employer that is a majority shareholder of an
      Employer identified in paragraph (ii) above, or any corporate
      Employer in a chain of corporations in which each corporation is a
      majority shareholder of another corporation in the chain, ending in a
      corporation identified in paragraph (ii) above.  For
      purposes of this paragraph (iii), a majority shareholder of a
      corporate Employer is a shareholder owning more than 50% of the total fair
      market value and total voting power of such
  Employer.




 




(ii)  


Persons
      Acting as a Group.  Persons will not be considered to be
      acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same
      corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering.
      However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are
      owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase
      or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the
      corporation. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both
      corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or
      acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is
      considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a
      corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not
      with respect to the ownership interest in the other
      corporation.




 




(iii)  


Ownership
      Attribution.  The ownership attribution rules of Code
      Section 318(a) shall apply to determine stock
      ownership.  Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned
      by the individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an
      unvested option is





 


 


25





 



 




  


not considered owned by the individual who
      holds the unvested option).  For purposes of the preceding
      sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock that is not
      substantially vested (as defined in IRS Regulation § 1.83-3(b) and
      (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the
      individual who holds the
  option.




 

Section
6.7  Special
Rule for Certain Delayed Payments.  Payment from a
Participant’s DSU Accounts that are calculated by reference to the value of
Company stock shall be treated as paid at a specified time or pursuant to a
fixed schedule in conformity with the requirements of the Plan if such amounts
are paid on the same schedule and under the same terms and conditions as
payments to shareholders generally pursuant to a Qualified Change in Control
Event described in Section 6.3 above (i.e., a change in the ownership of a
corporation) or as payments to the Participant pursuant to a Qualified Change in
Control Event  described in Section 6.5 above (i.e., a change in the
ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation’s assets).  Any
amounts paid pursuant to such a schedule and such terms and conditions will not
be treated as violating the initial or subsequent deferral election rules, to
the extent that such amounts are paid not later than five years after the
Qualified Change in Control Event.

BENEFICIARY
DESIGNATION
 
 
Section
7.1  Beneficiary
Designation. Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to
designate any person, persons or entity as his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. A
Beneficiary designation shall be made, and may be amended, by the Participant by
filing a written designation with the Plan Administration Committee, on such
form and in accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administration Committee
shall establish from time to time.
 
Section
7.2  No
Beneficiary Designation. If a Participant fails to designate a
Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the
Participant, then the Participant’s Beneficiary shall be the Participant’s
estate.

ARTICLE

ADMINISTRATION
OF PLAN
 
 
 
 
Section
8.1  Named
Fiduciaries.  The persons identified in this Section 8.1
are named as fiduciaries under this Plan and shall be the only named fiduciaries
with respect to the Plan.
 




(a)  


The
      Company, as Plan sponsor, shall be responsible for all fiduciary functions
      under the Plan except insofar as any such authority or responsibility is
      assigned by or pursuant to the Plan to another named fiduciary, or is
      delegated to another fiduciary pursuant to subsection (b)
      below.  In that regard, the Company shall be the “Administrator”
      of the Plan within the meaning of ERISA.  The authority and
      responsibility reserved or assigned to the Company shall be exercised by
      its Compensation Committee or other authorized officers, and shall include
      the authority and responsibility in regard to the
    following:




 




(i)  


The
      design of the Plan, including the right to amend and to terminate the
      Plan;




 




(ii)  


Establishing
      the criteria for Employees who are to be designated as Eligible Executives
      for any Plan Year; and




 




(iii)  


Considering
      and reviewing all appeals of claims which have been
  denied.




 




(b)  


The
      Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee or to any officer of
      the Company or any Affiliated Company any authority or responsibility
      reserved or assigned to the Company pursuant to the Plan.  In
      the event of any such delegation, then any references to the authority,
      right or power of the Company to act which are contained in any notice,
      disclosure or communication made with a view toward effectuating the
      purposes of the Plan shall be construed to include authority for such
      actions by the committee or officer to whom the Compensation Committee has
      delegated its authority.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
      the Plan, in the event that an action or direction of any person to whom
      authority reposed with the Company under the Plan has been delegated by
      the Compensation Committee conflicts with an action or direction of the
      Board of Directors, then the authority of the Compensation Committee shall
      supersede that of the delegate with respect to such action or
      direction.




 




(c)  


A
      Plan Administration Committee shall have the responsibility and authority
      to control the operation and administration of the Plan in accordance with
      the terms of the Plan.




 




(i)  


The
      members of the Plan Administration Committee shall be the individuals
      serving in the roles of, respectively, the Senior Vice President of Human
      Resources and the Vice President, Compensation and Benefits for the
      Employers, and such other individuals who are appointed to the Plan
      Administration Committee by such Senior Vice President of Human Resources
      (or, in the event of a vacancy in such position, by the Vice President,
      Compensation and Benefits).




 
 


 


28





 


 




(ii)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee may designate one of its members as a
      chairperson, and may retain and supervise outside providers, third party
      administrators, record keepers and professionals (including in-house
      professionals) to perform any or all of the duties delegated to it
      hereunder.




 




(d)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee shall be responsible for the administration
      of this Plan and shall have all powers necessary to administer this Plan,
      including discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits
      and to decide claims under the terms of this Plan, except to the extent
      that any such powers are vested in any other person administering this
      Plan by the Compensation Committee. The Plan Administration Committee may
      from time to time establish rules for the administration of this Plan, and
      it shall have the exclusive right to interpret this Plan and to decide any
      matters arising in connection with the administration and operation of
      this Plan. All rules, interpretations and decisions of the Plan
      Administration Committee shall be conclusive and binding on the Company,
      the Employers, Participants and
Beneficiaries.




 




(e)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee is expressly reposed with the discretionary
      authority and powers in regard to all facets of any claims for benefits
      made under the Plan.  In turn, the Compensation Committee is
      expressly reposed with the discretionary authority and powers in regard to
      all facets of the review of a denied claim for benefits.  Such
      authority and powers include, but are not limited to, the
      following:




 




(i)  


Construing
      and interpreting the terms of the Plan and of any documents pertaining to
      the Plan;




 




(ii)  


Construing
      and interpreting all laws and regulations as applicable to any claims for
      benefits made under the Plan;




 




(iii)  


Making
      any factual determinations, and applying such determinations to the terms
      of the Plan and issues arising under the Plan;
  and




 




(iv)  


Otherwise
      deciding all questions regarding an individual’s benefit entitlements
      under the Plan, and the manner and timing of any payments to be made to or
      with respect to any individual under the
Plan.




 




(f)  


No
      member of the Board, Compensation Committee or Plan Administration
      Committee shall be liable for any act or action hereunder, whether of
      omission or commission, by any other member or Employee or by any agent to
      whom duties in connection with the administration of this Plan have been
      delegated or for anything done or omitted to be done in connection with
      this Plan.




 




(g)  


The
      Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify each
      director, officer or Employee of the Company or any Affiliated Company
      (including the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal
      representatives of such person), each member of the Compensation Committee
      and Plan Administration Committee against expenses (including attorneys’
      fees), judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, actually and
      reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened,
      pending or actual suit, action or proceeding (whether civil, criminal,
      administrative or investigative in nature or
  otherwise)




 


 


29





 


 





 


in
      which such person may be involved by reason of the fact that he or she is
      or was serving this Plan in any capacity at the request of the Company or
      any other Affiliated Company, the Compensation Committee or the Plan
      Administration Committee.




 





(h)  


Any
      expense incurred by the Company, an Employer, the Compensation Committee
      or the Plan Administration Committee relative to the administration of
      this Plan shall be paid by the Company or other Affiliated Company and/or
      may be deducted from the DSU Accounts of the Participants as determined by
      the Compensation Committee.




 




(i)  


Any
      member of the Compensation Committee or the Plan Administration Committee
      may also be a Participant, but no committee member shall have power to
      take part in any discretionary decision or action affecting his own
      interest as a Participant under this Plan unless such decision or action
      is upon a matter which affects all other Participants similarly situated
      and confers no special right, benefit or privilege not simultaneously
      conferred upon all other such
Participants.




 
Section
8.2  Claim
Procedure.
 




(a)  


If
      a Participant or Beneficiary makes a written request alleging a right to
      receive payments under this Plan or alleging a right to receive an
      adjustment in benefits being paid under this Plan, such actions shall be
      treated as a claim for benefits. All claims for benefits under this Plan
      shall be sent to the Plan Administration
  Committee.




 




(b)  


If
      the Plan Administration Committee determines that any individual who has
      claimed a right to receive benefits, or different benefits, under this
      Plan is not entitled to receive all or any part of the benefits claimed,
      the Plan Administration Committee shall inform the claimant in writing of
      such determination and the reasons thereof in terms calculated to be
      understood by the claimant. The notice shall be sent within 90 days
      of the claim unless the Plan Administration Committee determines that
      additional time, not exceeding 90 days, is needed and so notifies the
      Participant. The notice shall make specific reference to the pertinent
      Plan provisions on which the denial is based, and shall describe any
      additional material or information that is necessary. Such notice shall,
      in addition, inform the claimant of the procedure that the claimant should
      follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the
      event the claimant desires to contest the denial of the claim, and the
      right of the claimant to bring a civil action under ERISA if the claim is
      denied upon further review.  Upon request, and free of charge,
      the claimant will be provided with reasonable access to, and copies of,
      all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for
      benefits.




 




(c)  


The
      claimant may within 90 days thereafter submit in writing to the Plan
      Administration Committee a notice that the claimant contests the denial of
      his or her claim and desires a further review of the denied
      claim.  The request for review will be directed to the
      Compensation Committee, which will review the claim and authorize the
      claimant to review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments
      relating to the claim. The Compensation Committee will render a final
      decision with specific reasons thereof in writing and will transmit it to
      the claimant within 60 days of the written request for review, unless
      the Compensation Committee determines that additional time, not exceeding
      




 


 


30





 


 





 


60 days,
      is needed, and so notifies the Participant.  If the claim is to
      be denied in whole or in part upon review, the written notice to the
      claimant will include the
following:




 





(i)  


The
      specific reason or reasons for the
denial;




 




(ii)  


Reference
      to the specific Plan provisions upon which the denial is
      based;




 




(iii)  


A
      statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, and free
      of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and
      other information relevant to the claim appeal;
  and




 




(iv)  


A
      statement of the claimant’s right to file a civil lawsuit under
      ERISA.




 




(d)  


Notwithstanding
      subsection (c) above, if the Compensation Committee holds regularly
      scheduled meetings at least quarterly, the Compensation Committee shall
      make a claim review determination no later than the date of the meeting of
      the committee that immediately follows the Plan’s receipt of a request for
      review, unless the request for review is filed within 30 days
      preceding the date of such meeting.  In such case, a claim
      review determination may be made by no later than the date of the second
      meeting following the Plan’s receipt of the request for
      review.  If special circumstances (such as the need to hold
      hearing) require a further extension of time for processing, a
      determination shall be rendered not later than the third meeting of the
      committee following the Plan’s receipt of the request for
      review.  If such an extension of time for review is required
      because of special circumstances, the claimant shall be provided with
      written notice of the extension, describing the special circumstances and
      the date as of which the claim review determination will be made, prior to
      the commencement of the extension.  The claimant shall be
      notified of the claim review determination as soon as possible, but not
      later than five days after the determination is
  made.

otherwise have a retroactive effect.  In addition, any amendment that
has the effect of changing the time or form of payment under the Plan with
respect to any Participant shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.7

      under the Plan are distributed for inclusion in the gross income of the
      Participant in the latest of:




 




(i)  


The
      calendar year in which the Plan termination
  occurs;




 




(ii)  


The
      calendar year in which the deferred amount is no longer subject to a

      in this Plan is concurrently
terminated;




 




(ii)  


No
      payments (other than payments that would be payable under the terms of the
      terminated programs if the terminations had not occurred) are made within
      12 months of the termination of the
  programs;




 




(iii)  


All
      payments are made within 24 months of the termination of the
      applicable programs; and




 


 


32





 


 




(iv)

termination.

MISCELLANEOUS
 
 
Section
10.1  Unfunded
Plan. This Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.  All
payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the
Employers and no special or separate fund shall be established or other
segregation of assets made to assure payment. No Participant or other person
shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or
assets of the Employers as a result of participating in the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employers may (but shall not be obligated to)
create one or more grantor trusts, the assets of which are subject to the claims
of the Employers’ creditors, to assist it in accumulating funds to pay its
obligations under the Plan.
 
Section
10.2  Nonassignability.
 




(a)  


Except
      as specifically set forth in the Plan with respect to the designation of
      Beneficiaries, neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any
      right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or
      otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual
      receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which
      are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable
      and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to
      actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of
      any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a
      Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law
      in the event of a Participant’s or any other person’s bankruptcy or
      insolvency.




 




(b)  


Notwithstanding
      the foregoing, the balance of a Participant’s DSU Accounts, or any portion
      thereof, shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of any domestic
      relations order which the Plan Administration Committee determines to be a
      qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) described in Section 414(p)
      of the Code.




 
Section
10. 3  Validity
and Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and
any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section
10.4  Governing
Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this
Plan shall in all respects be governed by the laws of the State of Virginia,
without reference to principles of conflict of law, except to the extent
preempted by federal law.
 
Section
10.5  Employment
Status. This Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or impose
on the Participant or any Employer any obligation for the Participant to remain
an Employee of the Employer or change the status of the Participant’s employment
or the policies of the Employer and its affiliates regarding termination of
employment.  The establishment or existence of the Plan also does not
constitute a contract of employment and shall not confer upon any individual the
right to be continued as a Director.
 


 


34





 


 
Section
10.6  No
Stockholder Rights Conferred.  Nothing contained in the Plan
will confer upon any Participant or Beneficiary any rights of a stockholder of
the Company, unless and until Shares are in fact issued or transferred to such
Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with Article V.
 
Section
10.7  Underlying
Incentive Plans and Programs. Nothing in this Plan shall prevent the
Company or other Employer from modifying, amending or terminating the
compensation or the incentive plans and programs pursuant to which cash awards
are earned and which are deferred under this Plan.
 
Section
10.8  Funding
and Financial Health Restrictions.  In no event shall any
amounts attributable to any DSU Account be held in an offshore trust within the
meaning of Code Section 409A(b)(1).  In addition, the assets of any

purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees within the meaning of Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).  It is the
intention of the Company that the Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for
purposes of Title I of ERISA.  The Plan constitutes a mere
promise by the Company to make deferred compensation payments in the
future.  As to such deferred compensation benefits, Participants under
the Plan have the status of a general, unsecured creditors of the
Company.

Date.  The Plan is a continuation of the Plan that was
originally adopted effective as of June 1, 2003.  Except as may
be expressly provided otherwise, the Plan is hereby amended and restated
effective as of January 1, 2008 for the purpose of becoming compliant with
final Code Section 409A regulations issued by the Internal Revenue
Service.
 
Section
1.4  Pre-2005
Deferrals.  Deferrals made under the Plan on or before
December 31, 2004, which were earned and not subject to a substantial risk
of forfeiture as of such date, shall be segregated and administered solely in
accordance with the Addendum to this Plan.

Section
2.28  Separation
from Service.
 




(a)  


Subject
      to the further provisions of this Section 2.28, a Participant will
      incur a Separation from Service for purposes of the Plan if the
      Participant dies, Retires, or otherwise has a termination of employment as
      to all the Affiliated Companies.




 




(b)  


An
      Participant’s employment relationship with an Affiliated Company will be
      treated as continuing intact, and thus the Participant will not be deemed
      to have incurred a Separation from Service, while the Participant is on
      military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the
      period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so
      long as the Participant retains a right to reemployment with the
      Affiliated Company under an applicable statute or by
      contract.  A leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of
      absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Participant
      will return to perform services for the Affiliated Company.  If
      the period of leave exceeds six months and the Participant does not
      retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract,
      the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first day
      immediately following such six-month
period.




 




(c)  


Whether
      a termination of employment has occurred is determined based on whether
      the facts and circumstances indicate that the Affiliated Company and the
      Participant reasonably anticipated that no further services would be
      performed after a certain date, or that the level of bona fide services
      the Participant would perform after such date (whether as an Employee or
      as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than
      20 percent of the average level of bona fide services
      performed  (whether as an Employee or an independent contractor)
      over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of
      services to the Affiliated Companies if the Participant has been providing
      services to the Affiliated Companies less than 36 months).  A
      Participant is presumed to have incurred a Separation from Service where
      the level of bona fide services performed decreases to a level equal to 20
      percent or less of the average level of services performed by the
      Participant during the immediately preceding 36-month period.  A
      Participant will be presumed not to have incurred a Separation from
      Service where the level of bona fide services performed continues at a
      level that is 50 percent or more of the average level of service performed
      by the Participant during the immediately preceding 36-month
      period.  No presumption applies to a decrease in the level of
      bona fide services performed to a level that is more than 20 percent, and
      less than 50 percent, of the average level of bona fide services performed
      during the immediately preceding 36-month
  period).




 
Section
2.29  Specified
Employee.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Plan, a “Specified Employee” means a Participant who
      is:




 




(i)  


A
      five-percent owner of an Affiliated Company;
or




 




(ii)  


A
      one-percent owner of an Affiliated Company having annual compensation of
      more than $150,000; or




 






5









 




(iii)  


An
      officer of an Affiliated Company, regardless of the level of the officer’s
      annual compensation for the Plan Year at issue.  In this regard,
      an “officer” means a Team Member whose position is that of a
      Vice-President or higher.




 




(b)  


A
      Participant’s status as a Specified Employee will be determined as of
      December 31 of each Plan Year (the “Identification Date”).  If
      applicable, such a determination will be based on the compensation earned
      by the Participant from the Affiliated Companies for the 12-month period
      ending on the Identification Date.




 




(c)  


A
      Participant who is determined to be a Specified Employee as of an
      Identification Date shall be treated as a Specified Employee for purposes
      of the distribution restrictions prescribed under Section 5.6 of the Plan
      for the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the month following
      the Identification Date (i.e., for the calendar year immediately following
      the Identification Date).




 




(d)  


If
      a publicly-traded corporation is acquired by, or merges into, the Company
      or other Affiliated Company, then any Team Member of the acquired or
      merged corporation who as of December 31 (the Identification Date)
      immediately following the corporation transaction, has become an officer
      of an Affiliated Company (as defined in paragraph (a)(iii) above), or who
      is an owner described in paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above, will be treated
      as a Specified Employee for purposes of this Plan through the last day of
      calendar year that is coincident with or next follows the date of the
      corporation transaction.  Thereafter, the Team Member’s status
      as a Specified Employee will be determined as prescribed
      above.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect to
      use any reasonable method to determine the Specified Employees for
      purposes of the Plan for periods immediately after the corporate
      transaction, provided that such method is adopted no later than 90 days
      after the corporate transaction and applied prospectively from the date
      the method is adopted.




 




(e)  


If
      a company that is not publicly-traded is acquired by or merges into the
      Company or other Affiliated Company, then the Team Members of the acquired
      or merged company will not be treated as Specified Employees for purposes
      of this Plan until the first day of the calendar year next following the
      acquisition.  Thereafter, the Team Member’s status as a
      Specified Employee shall be determined as prescribed
  above.




 




(f)  


A
      Participant who is not a current or former Team Member of the Company or
      any other Affiliated Company (i.e., an “outside” Director) is not a key
      employee, and therefore not a Specified Employee for purposes of the
      Plan.




 
Section
2.30  Specified
Time.  “Specified Time” means a designated Deferral Period with
respect to a Deferral Account that based on a stated number of years, as
prescribed in Section 3.5(b).
 
Section
2.31  Team
Member.  “Team Member” means an employee of the Company or
other Affiliated Company.

      Team Member who was a Participant in the Plan as of December 31, 2007
      shall continue as such, subject to the provisions of the
    Plan.




 




(b)  


Effective
      on and after January 1, 2008, a Team Member shall be eligible to
      participate in the Plan with respect to any Plan Year
  if:




 




(i)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee concludes that for such Plan Year, the Team
      Member is:




 




(A)  


Expected
      to be compensated in an amount such that the sum of the Team Member’s Base

$100,000;




 




(B)  


A
      “highly-compensated employee” for the Plan Year at issue under a
      Section 401(k) plan maintained by an Employer by reason of the Team
      Member’s compensation for the prior Plan Year;
  or




 




(C)  


A
      newly-hired Team Member, and is expected to receive compensation from the
      Employer at a level which, if annualized, will equal or exceed the dollar
      amount that will be used to establish a person’s status as a “highly
      compensated employee” under Code Section 414(q) for the following
      year.




 




(ii)  


As
      of the first day of the Plan Year, the Team Member is at least

      Section 401(k) plan maintained by an Employer at the maximum rate
      allowed with respect to such Team Member under the Section 401(k)
      plan.  This condition applies only if the Team Member is
      eligible to participate in such a Section 401(k)
  plan.




 




(c)  


A
      Participant who is transferred from an Employer to employment with an
      Affiliated Company that is not an Employer with respect to the Plan, or
      who while continuing in the employ of an Employer ceases to be an eligible
      Team Member (a “Transferred Participant”), shall not be considered to have
      incurred a Separation from Service.  The Transferred Participant
      shall continue to be eligible to make deferrals under the Plan through the
      end of the Plan Year in which such transfer occurs, or for such additional
      period as may be permitted by the Compensation
  Committee.

      Compensation for a Plan Year consist of Base Salary, Quarterly Bonuses and
      Roll-up Performance Bonus.  For administrative convenience, the
      Plan Administration Committee can combine the elections for two or more
      forms of the Eligible Compensation on a single form.  The
      submission of the Deferral Election Agreement must be made in accordance
      with such policies and procedures established by the Plan Administration
      Committee and communicated to eligible Team Members, which procedures may
      permit or require elections to be made by electronic
  media.




 




(b)  


The
      Deferral Election Agreement with respect to each form of Eligible
      Compensation shall include the elections and descriptions prescribed
      below.




 




(i)  


The
      amount of the Team Member’s Eligible Compensation to be deferred for the
      Plan Year (the “Deferred Amount”), as described more fully in
      Section 3.4;




 




(ii)  


The
      designated payment event for such Deferred Amount, as described more fully
      in Section 3.5;




 




(iii)  


The
      form in which the Deferred Amount is elected to be paid, as described more
      fully in Section 3.6; and




 




(iv)  


The
      manner in which the Deferred Amount shall be deemed to be invested, as
      described in Section 4.4.




 
Section
3.4  Deferred
Amount.
 




 
      


(a)


The
      Deferral Election Agreement of an eligible Team Member for a Plan Year
      shall designate the amount of each form of the Eligible Compensation for
      the Plan Year that the Team Member elects to have deferred under the Plan
      (the “Deferred Amount”).  An eligible Team Member shall
      make a separate deferral election for each form of the Team Member’s
      Eligible Compensation (i.e., Base Salary, Quarterly Bonus and Roll-up
      Performance Bonus) for the Plan Year.  The maximum or minimum
      amount of deferral that may be elected by a Team Member for a Plan Year
      with respect to each form of Eligible Compensation shall be established by
      the Plan Administration Committee.




 




 
      


(b)


The
      aspect of a Deferral Election Agreement regarding the elected Deferred
      Amount shall not apply to any pay period for which the amount of the
      Eligible Compensation remaining to be paid to the Team Member (but for the
      deferral election), after making any other deductions or withholdings of
      income, would be less than the Deferred Amount prescribed in the Deferral
      Election Agreement

(c)  


Notwithstanding
      an eligible Team Member’s election to the contrary, if the Team Member is
      eligible to make elective deferrals under a Code Section 401(k) plan
      maintained by an Employer for any period for which the Team Member is
      eligible to participate in the Plan, the Team Member’s deferral election
      with respect to the Plan for a Plan Year, or for any period during a Plan
      Year, shall not apply unless and until the Team Member has made the
      maximum elective deferrals to the Section 401(k) plan permitted by
      Code Section 402(g), or has made the maximum elective deferrals for a
      period permitted under the terms of the Section 401(k)
      plan.




 
Section
3.5  Designated
Payment Event.  A Team Member’s Deferral Election Agreement
must designate the event that will give rise to the payment of the Deferred
Amount.  The period of the deferral through the date of the event
giving rise to the payment of the Deferred Amount is sometimes referred to
herein as the “Deferral Period.”  Subject to the terms of the Plan,
including Section 5.6 (regarding the restriction on distributions to
Specified Employees), a Team Member may elect to have the Deferred Amount
pertaining to services performed in any Plan Year become payable upon
(i.e., to be deferred until) either of the following alternative
events:
 




(a)  


The
      Team Member’s Retirement or other Separation from Service;
    or




 




(b)  


The
      expiration of a stated number of full calendar years, not less than two,
      following the Plan Year to which the deferred compensation pertains
      (i.e., as of a “Specified Time”).  For example, a Team
      Member may elect to have a Deferral Account pertaining to Year 1
      compensation be deferred for the period ending on December 31 of Year
      3, or until the last day of any subsequent calendar
  year.




 
Notwithstanding
the terms of a Deferral Election Agreement, a Participant’s Retirement shall be
a designated payment event with respect to each of the Participant’s Deferral
Accounts.  Accordingly, if such Retirement occurs prior to the
occurrence of the Specified Time designated in any Deferral Election Agreement
for any Deferral Account, then the Retirement shall supplant the Specified Time
election with respect to that  Deferral Account.
 
Section
3.6  Form of
Payment.
 




(a)  


A
      Participant’s Deferral Election Agreement shall designate the form in
      which the Deferred Amount will be paid if such payments arise by reason of
      a designated payment event prescribed in Section 3.5
      above.  The permissive forms of payment
  are:




 




(i)  


A
      lump sum; or




 




(ii)  


Substantially
      equal annual installments over a period (as the Participant shall
      designate) of not less than two years and not more than
      10 years.




 




(b)  


If
      the distribution of a Participant’s Deferral Account is to be made in
      annual installments, then the annual cash payments to be made from the
      Participant’s Deferral Account shall be determined by reference to
      a  fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator
      of which is the number of remaining installments (including the
      installment being paid).  Each installment shall be deemed to be
      made on a pro rata basis from each 





 






9









 




 


of
      the different deemed investments of the Deferral Account (if there is more
      than one such deemed investment).




 


 
Section
3.7  Deferral
Election Deadline.

 




(a)  


A
      Deferral Election pertaining to any Base Salary or Quarterly Bonuses that
      may otherwise become payable to a Participant for services performed
      during a Plan Year, including in regard to the fourth quarter Quarterly
      Bonus for a Plan Year that will be paid after the end of that Plan Year,
      must be submitted on or before December 31 of the Plan Year
      immediately preceding the Plan Year for which it is effective
      (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier submission date
      established by the Plan Administration
  Committee.




 




(b)  


A
      Deferral Election pertaining to any Roll-up Performance Bonus that may
      otherwise become payable to a Participant for services performed during a
      Plan Year must be submitted on or before December 31 of the Plan Year
      immediately preceding the Plan Year performance period for which it is
      effective (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier submission
      date established by the Plan Administration
      Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation
      Committee in its discretion may permit Participants to submit the Deferral
      Election for the Roll-up Performance Bonus pertaining to any Plan Year on
      or before June 30 falling within the applicable Plan Year
      (a “Statutory Deadline”), or as of such earlier submission date
      established by the Plan Administration Committee, subject to the following
      conditions:




 




(i)  


The
      Participant must have performed services for the Employer continuously
      during the period beginning on the later of the beginning of the
      performance period or the date the applicable performance criteria are
      established, and ending on the date the election is made;
    and




 




(ii)  


The
      election is made before the amount of the Roll-up Performance Bonus
      becomes readily ascertainable.




 
Section
3.8  Election for
First Year of Eligibility.  Notwithstanding Section 3.7 above,
the provisions of this Section 3.8 shall apply with respect to a Team Member who
becomes eligible to participate in the Plan after the first day of a Plan
Year.
 




(a)  


The
      timing of the eligible Team Member’s initial Deferral Election shall be
      governed by the rules prescribed
below.




 




(i)  


The
      initial Deferral Election must be made within 30 days after the date
      the individual becomes such an eligible Team Member.  Except as
      provided in paragraph (ii) below, the eligible Team Member’s initial
      Deferral Election, or the decision to not make an initial Deferral
      Election, shall become irrevocable as of the expiration of such 30-day
      election period.




 




(ii)  


Notwithstanding
      paragraph (i) above, an initial Deferral Election by an eligible Team
      Member with respect to a Quarterly Bonus or a Roll-up Performance Bonus
      that is affirmatively made and submitted under the Plan by the last day of
      the quarter or Plan Year preceding the quarter or Plan Year for which the
      Deferral 




 






10









 

 




  


Election
      will first apply, and before the expiration of the otherwise applicable
      30-day election period, shall become irrevocable as of the last day of
      such preceding quarter or Plan
Year.




 





(iii)  


In
      no event may the deadline for making an initial Deferral Election under
      this Plan with respect to any eligible Team Member for any Plan Year be
      subsequent to the deadline imposed on that Eligible Individual for making
      a Deferral Election for such Plan Year under any other Aggregated
      Plan.




 




(b)  


A
      former Participant who has again become an eligible Team Member shall be
      treated as first becoming eligible to participate in the Plan, and thus
      shall be subject to the special election rules of this Section 3.8,
      under either of the following
circumstances:




 




(i)  


The
      former Participant has been paid all amounts deferred under the Plan and
      all other Aggregated Plans, and the Participant ceased to be eligible to
      elect to continue to participate in the Plan or an Aggregated Plan on or
      before the date of the last such payment;
or




 




(ii)  


The
      former Participant was not eligible to participate in the Plan or an
      Aggregated Plan during the 24-month period ending on the date of again
      becoming eligible to participate in the Plan or an Aggregated
      Plan.




 




(c)  


The
      compensation to which such initial Deferral Election will apply shall be
      determined in accordance with the rules set forth
  below.




 




(i)  


The
      eligible Team Member’s initial Deferral Election shall apply only to the
      Eligible Compensation otherwise payable for services performed by the
      eligible Team Member subsequent to the date the Deferral Election has
      become irrevocable pursuant to subsection (a)
  above.




 




(ii)  


For
      purposes of paragraph (i) above, as with respect to a Deferral
      Election by an eligible Team Member pertaining to a Quarterly or Roll-up
      Performance Bonus, if the initial Deferral Election is made after the
      beginning of the applicable bonus performance period, the Deferral
      Election shall apply to the total amount of Eligible Compensation for the
      applicable performance period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
      which is the number of days remaining in the performance period after the
      election has become irrevocable, and the denominator of which is the total
      number of days in the performance
period.




 




(iii)  


The
      formula prescribed in paragraph (ii) above shall also apply in regard
      to a Deferral Election pertaining to the deferral of the eligible Team
      Member’s Base Salary, unless the amount of the individual’s Eligible
      Compensation for the portion of a period prior to the date of the
      irrevocability of the Deferral Election (i.e., the amount of the
      Eligible Compensation that is not eligible to be deferred under the Plan)
      can be readily ascertained.




 






11









 
Section
3.9  Irrevocability of
Election. 
 




(a)  


Once
      the applicable Statutory Deadline to make a Deferral Election for any form
      of Eligible Compensation with respect to any Plan Year has passed, as
      prescribed in Section 3.7, or once the deadline for making an initial
      Deferral Election pursuant to Section 3.8 above has expired, the Deferral
      Election shall generally become irrevocable.  The consequences
      of such include the following:




 




(i)  


The
      amount of the Eligible Compensation that the Participant elected to defer
      for the Plan Year, or the election not to defer any amount, cannot be
      canceled or modified;




 




(ii)  


The
      form of payment for the Deferral Account to which the Deferred Election
      applies cannot be modified; and




 




(iii)  


The
      designated date of payment for the Deferral Account to which the Deferred
      Election applies cannot be modified, except as provided in
      Section 5.8.




 




(b)  


Notwithstanding
      subsection (a) above, an eligible Team Member who receives a hardship
      withdrawal from a Section 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or
      another Affiliated Company, and who is thereupon suspended from making
      elective deferrals under all qualified and non-qualified plans of the
      Affiliated Companies pursuant to IRS Regulation § 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)
      and the terms of the 401(k) plan, shall have his or her Deferral Election
      under this Plan thereupon canceled on a prospective basis.  Such
      Deferral Election cancellation rule shall be subject to the
      following:




 




(i)  


An
      eligible Team Member’s Deferral Election shall not be canceled upon the
      hardship withdrawal if the 401(k) plan does not require the suspension of
      elective deferrals; and




 




(ii)  


An
      eligible Team Member whose Deferral Election is canceled pursuant to the
      above, and who thereafter becomes eligible to resume making deferrals
      under this Plan, shall nevertheless remain subject to the general election
      deadline rules prescribed under this
      Section 3.9.  Accordingly, the eligible Team Member shall
      not be permitted to resume making elective deferrals under this Plan for
      any period prior to the first day of the Plan Year following the
      expiration of the elective deferral suspension period under the applicable
      401(k) plan.




 




(c)  


Further
      notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the Deferral Election of a
      Participant who receives an Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal from the
      Plan pursuant to Section 5.11 shall be cancelled on a prospective
      basis.  Such cancellation shall continue in effect for the
      remainder of the Plan Year in which the withdrawal is made.  The
      Participant, if otherwise so eligible, shall be permitted to elect to make
      elective deferrals under the Plan for the subsequent Plan
      Year.




 






12









 
Section
3.10  Evergreen
Elections.
 




(a)  


Prior
      to each Deferral Election Agreement submission deadline, each eligible
      Team Member shall be provided information regarding the eligible Team
      Member’s deferral rights under the Plan for the following Plan Year or
      other applicable period.  The eligible Team Member shall then be
      permitted to affirmatively elect or decline to enter into a Deferral
      Election Agreement for the applicable period.  In the event that
      an eligible Team Member fails to timely submit a Deferral Election
      Agreement, or fails to affirmatively decline to enter into a Deferral
      Election Agreement, for any period, then the Eligible Individual shall be
      deemed to have made the same Deferral Election (or election declination)
      as had most recently been made for the form of Eligible Compensation at
      issue.




 




(b)  


Subject
      to Section 3.9(b) above (regarding the cancellation of a Deferred
      Election upon a 401(k) plan hardship withdrawal), a deemed election shall
      become irrevocable as of the applicable Statutory Deadline (as prescribed
      in Section 3.7).  For example, an eligible Team Member who
      fails to make or affirmatively decline a Deferral Election Agreement in
      regard to Base Salary payable for Year 2 will be deemed to have made
      the same Base Salary Deferral Election, or election declination, as in
      effect for Year 1.  An eligible Team Member who is first
      eligible to make a Deferral Election for any form of Eligible
      Compensation, but fails to timely make such election, shall be deemed to
      have declined such Deferral Election.  Subject to
      subsection (c) below, this deemed evergreen election shall apply to
      all aspects of an eligible Team Member’s Deferral Election, including in
      regard to the designated Deferral
Period.




 




(c)  


The
      Deferral Period applicable to a evergreen election deemed to be made under
      this Section 3.10 with respect to any form of Eligible Compensation
      shall be determined as prescribed
below.




 




(i)  


If
      the most recent Deferral Election for the form of Eligible Compensation at
      issue designated a Deferral Period extending to the eligible Team Member’s
      Retirement or other Separation from Service, then that same designation
      shall apply to the deemed evergreen
election.




 




(ii)  


If
      the most recent Deferral Election for the form of Eligible Compensation
      designated a deferral of payment for a Specified Time, then that Specified
      Time shall be deemed to have also been elected; provided, however, if that
      Specified Time is not the end of at least two full calendar years
      following the beginning of the Plan Year to which the deemed evergreen
      election applies, then the Deferral Period for a Deferred Amount that is
      the subject of the deemed election shall be the end of such second future
      calendar year.




 
Section
3.11  Non-Elective Employer
Deferrals.
 




(a)  


An
      Employer may, at any time and in its complete discretion, make Matching
      Contributions or other non-elective employer deferrals on behalf of any
      eligible Team Member for any Plan
Year.




 






13









 




(b)  


Any
      non-elective employer deferrals made by an Employer with respect to an
      eligible Team Member shall be maintained in a separate Deferral Account
      established on the Team Member’s
behalf.




 




(c)  


Except
      as otherwise prescribed under the Plan, a Team Member’s Deferral Account
      pertaining to non-elective employer deferrals for any Plan Year shall
      become payable at such time, and in such form, as prescribed in the
      Deferral Election Agreement made (or deemed to have been made) by the Team
      Member with respect to the Team Member’s Base Salary for the Plan Year at
      issue; provided, however, that the specified payment date for such
      Deferral Account shall not precede the last day of the Plan Year as of
      which such Deferral Account has become vested pursuant to
      Section 4.3(b) below.




 




(d)  


Non-elective
      employer deferrals pertaining to any Plan Year shall be invested pursuant
      to the same Hypothetical Investment Benchmarks and in the same proportion
      as prescribed in the deferrals of the Team Member’s Base Salary for such
      Plan Year.

MAINTENANCE
AND INVESTMENT OF ACCOUNTS

 
Section
4.1  Maintenance
of Deferral Accounts.  Separate Deferral Accounts shall be
maintained for each Participant. More than one Deferral Account may be
maintained for a Participant as necessary to reflect various Hypothetical
Investment Benchmarks, or separate Deferral Election Agreements specifying
different Deferral Periods and/or forms of payment.  A Participant’s
Deferral Accounts shall be utilized solely as a device for the measurement and
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Participant pursuant to this
Plan, and shall not constitute or be treated as a trust fund of any kind. The
Plan Administration Committee shall determine the balance of each Deferral
Account, as of each Valuation Date, by adjusting the balance of such Deferral
Account as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date to reflect changes in the
value of the deemed investments thereof, credits and debits pursuant to
Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 and distributions pursuant to
Article V with respect to such Deferral Account since the preceding
Valuation Date.
 
Section
4.2  Crediting of
Deferred Compensation.  The Deferred Amount of a Participant
with respect to each Plan Year of participation in the Plan shall be credited to
the Participant’s Deferral Account as and when such Deferred Amount would
otherwise have been paid to the Participant.  To the extent that an
Employer is required to withhold any taxes or other amounts from the Deferred
Amount pursuant to any state, Federal or local law, such amounts shall be taken
out of other compensation eligible to be paid to the Participant that is not
deferred under this Plan.
 
Section
4.3  Vesting.
 




(a)  


Except
      as provided in subsection (b) below, a Participant shall be 100%
      vested in the balance of each of his or her Deferral Accounts at all
      times.




 




(b)  


A
      Participant shall become vested in a Deferral Account pertaining to
      Matching Contributions or other non-elective employer contributions made
      for any Plan Year (a “Matching Contribution Deferral Account”) as of the
      earliest to occur of the following:




 




(i)  


The
      passage of two Plan Years following the Plan Year to which such
      non-elective employer contributions pertain during each of which the
      Participant completes at least 1,000 hours of
  service;




 




(ii)  


The
      date as of which the Participant, while employed by an Employer or other
      Affiliated Company, dies or becomes Disabled;
  and




 




(iii)  


The
      date as of which the Participant
Retires.




 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company, in its sole discretion, may waive or reduce the
foregoing vesting standard for the Matching Contribution Deferral Account of any
Participant.
 






15









 




 
      


(c)


Amounts
      held in a Matching Contribution Deferral Account of a Participant who
      terminates employment prior to becoming vested such account as prescribed
      in subsection (b) above shall be forfeited and used to pay the
      administrative expenses of the
Plan.




 
Section
4.4  Hypothetical
Investment Benchmarks.  Each Participant shall be entitled to
direct the manner in which his/her Deferral Accounts will be deemed to be
invested, selecting among the Hypothetical Investment Benchmarks specified in
Appendix A hereto, as amended from time to time, and in accordance with such
rules, regulations and procedures as the Plan Administration Committee may
establish from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
earnings and losses based on a Participant’s investment elections shall begin to
accrue as of the date the  Participant’s Deferred  Amounts
are credited to his or her Deferral Accounts.
 
Section
4.5  Statement of
Accounts.  Each Participant shall be provided quarterly
statements of his or her Deferral Accounts, in such form as the Plan
Administration Committee deems desirable, setting forth the balance to the
credit of such Participant in his or her Deferral Accounts as of the end of the
most recently completed quarter.

The  Participant
      had elected to receive payment of a Deferral Account upon Retirement;
      or




 




(b)  


The
      Deferral Period elected by the Participant for that Deferral Account was a
      Specified Time, but the Participant Retires before the end of that
      Specified Time.




 
Section
5.3  Specified
Time Distributions.  Subject to Sections 5.6 and 5.8
below, if the Deferral Period elected by a Participant with respect to a

in installments or in a lump sum as designated in the applicable Deferral
Election Agreement.
 
Section
5.4  Other
Payment Events.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any Deferral
Election Agreement, if prior to Retirement a Participant dies, becomes Disabled
but remains employed, or incurs a Separation from Service, the entire balance of
all of the Participant’s Deferral Accounts shall be distributed to the
Participant or the Participant’s Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (as the case may
be) in a lump sum payment.
 
Section
5.5  Designated

(a)  


The
      designated date as of which the value of a Participant’s Deferral Account
      is to be distributed, or shall commence being distributed, shall be as
      prescribed below.




 






17













(i)  


The
      designated payment date with respect to a Deferral Account to be
      distributed in a lump sum payment, including with respect to a lump sum
      payment made to a Participant’s Beneficiary upon the Participant’s death,
      shall be the first day following the date of the event giving rise to the
      lump sum payment (or, if later, the date as of which the final deferral
      with respect to the Deferral Election Agreement pertaining to the Deferral
      Account is withheld from the Participant’s
  paycheck).




 




(ii)  


In
      the case of distributions to be made to a Participant in the form of
      installment payments, the designated payment dates shall be the first day
      of the month following the event that gives rise to the payment, and each
      annual anniversary of that initial designated payment
  date.




 




(iii)  


The
      designated payment date with respect to a withdrawal due to an
      Unforeseeable Emergency pursuant to Section 5.9 below shall be the
      date as of which the withdrawal request is approved by the Plan
      Administration Committee.




 




(b)  


For
      purposes of the administrative provisions of this Plan, a payment shall be
      treated as having been made upon the date specified under
      subsection (a) above if the payment is
  made:




 




(i)  


On
      such date or a later date within the same calendar year;
  or




 




(ii)  


If
      later, by the 15th
      day of the third calendar month following the date so
      specified.




 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if calculation of the amount of the payment is not
administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Participant
(or the Participant’s estate), the payment will be treated as made upon the
specified date if the payment is made during the first calendar year in which
the payment is administratively practicable.
 
For
purposes of administrative convenience, payment may be made to a Participant no
earlier than 30 days before the designated payment date prescribed in subsection
(a) above.
 
In no
event shall a Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the
taxable year of the distribution.
 




(c)  


The
      amount to be distributed to a Participant shall be determined on the basis
      of the value of the applicable Deferral Account as of the designated
      payment date with respect to the distribution at
  issue.




 
Section
5.6  Restriction
on Distributions to Specified Employees.
 




(a)  


Notwithstanding
      the provisions of Section 5.5 above, if a Participant is a Specified
      Employee as of the date of the Participant’s Retirement or other
      Separation from Service, then, by reason of such event, the amounts held
      in the Participant’s Deferral Accounts shall become payable as of the
      first day of the seventh month following the date of
      the




 






18










 




 


Participant’s
      Retirement or other Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as of the
      date of the Participant’s death).




 





(b)  


If
      the distributions to the Specified Employee are to be made in annual
      installments, the delay in payment prescribed in subsection (a)(ii)
      above shall apply solely to the first installment payment.  Each
      subsequent installment payment shall be made as of the date such payment
      otherwise would have been made pursuant to
    Section 5.5.




 




(c)  


The
      distribution restrictions prescribed in subsection (a)(ii) above
      shall not apply to a payment to be made pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i)
      or (ii) (regarding the payment of employment taxes and compensation
      deferred under the Plan or a certificate of divesture compliance
      distributions), or Section 10.2(b) (regarding domestic relations
      orders).




 
Section
5.7  No
Acceleration of Scheduled Distributions.
 




(a)  


Except
      as otherwise provided in the Plan, the time or schedule of any
      distribution of any portion of a Participant’s Deferral Accounts shall not
      be permitted to be accelerated, either at the election of the Participant
      or at the discretion of the Compensation
  Committee.




 




(b)  


Notwithstanding
      the foregoing, distributions may be made to or on behalf of a Participant
      prior to the otherwise applicable designated payment date in the following
      situations:




 




(i)  


As
      may be necessary to comply with a certificate of divestiture (as defined
      in Code Section 1043(b)(2));




 




(ii)  


To
      pay FICA taxes on amounts deferred under the Plan, or income taxes on
      additional charges arising from the Employer’s payment of FICA taxes or
      for amounts attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes;
      or




 




(iii)  


If
      the Plan at any time fails to meet the requirements of Code
      Section 409A and the underlying regulations.  In that
      event, however, the accelerated payment may not exceed the amount required
      to be included in the Participant’s income as a result of the Plan’s
      failure to comply with the Code Section 409A
      requirements.




 
Section
5.8  Extension of
Specified Time Deferral Period.  Section 3.5(b) of the
Plan permits a Participant to select a Deferral Period of a stated period of
calendar years (i.e., a “Specified Time Deferral Period”).  In
this connection, a Participant shall be permitted to extend a Specified Time
Deferral Period with respect to a Deferral Account, subject to the conditions
set forth below.
 




(a)  


An
      election to extend the Specified Time Deferral Period with respect to any
      Deferral Account must be submitted to the Plan Administration Committee in
      accordance with its established
procedures.




 




(b)  


Any
      such election shall not take effect under the Plan until 12 months
      after the date on which the election is submitted to the Plan
      Administration Committee.




 




(c)  


An
      election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must provide for the
      lengthening of the Specified Time Deferral Period for a period of not less
      than an additional five years.




 






19









 




(d)  


Any
      election to extend a Specified Time Deferral Period must be made at least
      12 months prior to the designated payment date (as prescribed in
      Section 5.5(a)) for the first scheduled payment from the
      applicable  Deferral
Account.




 




(e)  


For
      purposes of this Section 5.8:




 




(i)  


The
      entitlement to installment payments shall be treated as the entitlement to
      a single payment; and




 




(ii)  


The
      applicable designated payment date otherwise applicable to a Specified
      Time Deferral Period shall be determined without regard to the
      restrictions on distributions to Specified Employees prescribed in
      Section 5.6.




 
Section
5.9  Delay of
Payments Under Certain Circumstances.  Notwithstanding any
provision of the Plan to the contrary, payment to a Participant will be delayed
to a date after the designated payment date otherwise prescribed under
Section 5.5 under any of the circumstances prescribed below.
 




(a)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee
      reasonably anticipates that the Company’s or other Affiliated Company’s
      income tax deduction with respect to such payment otherwise would be
      limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m);
      provided, however, that in such event, the payment shall be made either at
      the earliest date at which the Compensation Committee reasonably
      anticipates that the deduction of the payment of the amount will not be
      limited or eliminated by application of Code Section 162(m), or the
      calendar year in which the Participant Separates from
    Service.




 




(b)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee
      reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate a term
      of a loan agreement , or other similar contract, to which the Company or
      any other Affiliated Company is a party, and such violation will cause
      material harm to the Company or other Affiliated Company; provided,
      however, that in such event, the payment shall be made at the earliest
      date at which the Compensation Committee reasonably anticipates that the
      making of the payment will not cause such violation, or such violation
      will not cause material harm to the Company or other Affiliated
      Company.




 




(c)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed where the Compensation Committee
      reasonably anticipates that the making of the payment will violate federal
      securities laws or other applicable law; provided, however, that in such
      event, the payment to be made at the earliest date at which the Company or
      other Affiliated Company reasonably anticipates that the making of the
      payment will not cause such violation.  For purposes of this
      subsection (c), the making of a payment that would cause inclusion in
      gross income or other application of any penalty provision or other
      provision of the Code is not treated as a violation of applicable
      law.




 




(d)  


A
      payment to a Participant will be delayed upon such other events and
      conditions as may be prescribed in generally applicable guidance issued by
      the Internal Revenue Service.




 
Section
5.10  Cash  Payments.  All
distributions under the Plan shall be paid in cash.
 






20









 
Section
5.11  Unforeseeable Emergency
Withdrawals.  A Participant who incurs an Unforeseeable
Emergency (as defined below) may submit a request to the Plan Administration
Committee for a withdrawal equal to that portion (or all) of the Participant’s
Deferral Accounts as is then needed to alleviate the financial hardship
resulting therefrom.  Such withdrawals shall be subject to the
following provisions of this Section 5.11.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Section 5.11:




 




(i)  


An
      “Unforeseeable Emergency” means a severe financial hardship to a
      Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, or
      of the spouse, a dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)) or a
      primary beneficiary (as defined below) of the Participant; the loss of the
      Participant’s property due to casualty; or other similar extraordinary and
      unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the
      control of the Participant; and




 




(ii)  


A
      ”primary beneficiary” of a Participant is an individual who is named as a
      Beneficiary of the Participant under the Plan, and who has an
      unconditional right to all, or a portion of, the balance of the
      Participant’s Deferral Account upon the death of the
      Participant.




 




(b)  


The
      circumstances that will constitute an Unforeseeable Emergency will depend
      upon the facts of each case.  Examples of circumstances that may
      qualify as an Unforeseeable Emergency (provided that the other conditions
      of this Section 5.11 are satisfied)
are:




 




(i)  


The
      imminent foreclosure of, or eviction from, the Participant’s primary
      residence;




 




(ii)  


The
      need to pay for medical expenses, including non-refundable deductibles or
      the cost of prescription drugs; and




 




(iii)  


The
      need to pay for the funeral expenses of the spouse, or dependent or
      primary beneficiary of the
Participant.




 
The
purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are not Unforeseeable
Emergencies for purposes of this Plan.
 




(c)  


A
      withdrawal shall not be permitted under this Section 5.11 to the extent
      that the hardship resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency is, or may
      be, relieved:




 




(i)  


Through
      the reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
    otherwise;




 




(ii)  


By
      the liquidation of the Participant’s assets, to the extent the liquidation
      of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship;
      or




 




(iii)  


By
      the cessation of deferrals under the
Plan.




 




(d)  


The
      amount of any Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal shall be limited to that
      which the Plan Administration Committee determines is reasonably necessary
      to alleviate the hardship resulting from the occurrence of the
      Unforeseeable Emergency (which may 




 






21










 




  


include
      any amount necessary to pay any federal or state income taxes or penalties
      reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution).  The
      determination of the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency
      need must take into account any additional compensation that is available
      to the Participant upon cancellation of the Participant’s deferral
      election due to the Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal that is effected
      pursuant to Section 3.9(c).  However, such determination is not
      required to take into account any additional Unforeseeable Emergency
      withdrawal that is available under another nonqualified deferred
      compensation plan, but which has not actually been paid from that other
      plan.




 





(e)  


After
      reviewing each Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawal request, the Plan
      Administration Committee shall make a determination as to whether the
      circumstances satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency standards prescribed
      above, and will thereupon notify the requesting Participant of the
      determination.  If the request is approved, the Plan
      Administration Committee shall process payment of the
      withdrawal




 




(f)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee may establish a policy and procedures
      regarding the order in which Unforeseeable Emergency withdrawals are to be
      charged against the particular Deferral Accounts of a
      Participant.




 
Section
5.12  Withholding
of Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Employer
shall withhold from payments made hereunder any amounts required to be so
withheld by any applicable law or regulation.
 
Section
5.13  USERRA
Rights.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Article V to the
contrary, the Plan shall permit a Participant to elect a change in the time or
the form of payment as may be required to comply with the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).

ARTICLE
VI

PAYMENTS
UPON QUALIFIED CHANGE IN CONTROL EVENT

 
Section
6.1  Termination
of Plan upon Change in Control.  Notwithstanding any provision
of the Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Qualified Change in
Control Event involving the Company or other Relevant Employer (as defined in
Section 6.6(a) below), the Board as constituted immediately prior to the
event may in its discretion terminate the Plan, or the portion of the Plan
pertaining to the Relevant Employer, and cause to be distributed to each
affected Participant the entire balance of all of the Participant’s Deferral
Accounts (including the balance of any non-vested Matching Contribution
Accounts).  The termination by such Board must occur within the
30 days preceding, or within the 12-month period following, the Qualified
Change in Control Event.  Such Plan termination distributions shall be
permitted only if:
 




(a)  


All
      substantially similar non-qualified deferred compensation programs
      maintained by the Company and all other Affiliated Companies are
      terminated upon such Qualified Change in Control Event;
  and




 




(b)  


All
      compensation deferred and held under each such deferred compensation
      program is distributed to Participants within 12 months of the date
      of termination of the applicable
program.




 
Section
6.2  Qualified
Change in Control Event.  For purposes of this Article VI,
a “Qualified Change in Control Event” with respect to any Participant means any
of the following events:
 




(a)  


A
      Qualified change in the ownership of a corporation that is a Relevant
      Employer (as prescribed in
Section 6.3);




 




(b)  


A
      Qualified change in effective control of a corporation that is a Relevant
      Employer (as prescribed in Section 6.4);
  and




 




(c)  


A
      Qualified Change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets
      of a corporation that is a Relevant Employer (as prescribed in
      Section 6.5).




 
Section
6.3  Change in
the Ownership of a Corporation.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the ownership of a
      corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one
      person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the corporation
      that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more
      than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power
      of the stock of such corporation.  If any one person, or more
      than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than
      50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of
      the stock of a corporation, the acquisition of additional stock by the
      same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the
      ownership of the corporation (or to cause a change in the effective
      control of the corporation within the meaning of Section 6.4
      below).




 






23









 




(b)  


For
      purposes of this Section 6.3, an increase in the percentage of stock
      owned by any one person, or by persons acting as a group, as a result of a
      transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchange for
      property will be treated as an acquisition of
  stock.




 




(c)  


In
      all regards, for purposes of this Section 6.3, a change in the
      ownership of a corporation will be deemed to have occurred only when there
      is a transfer of stock of a corporation (or issuance of stock of a
      corporation), and stock in such corporation remains outstanding after the
      transaction.




 
Section
6.4  Change in
the Effective Control of a Corporation.
 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the effective control of a
      corporation occurs on the date that
either:




 




(i)  


A
      majority of members of the Company’s Board is replaced during any 12-month
      period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a
      majority of the members of the Company’s Board prior to the date of the
      appointment or election; or




 




(ii)  


Any
      one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has
      acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
      acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the
      applicable corporation possessing 30 percent or more of the total
      voting power of the stock of such
corporation.




 




(b)  


A
      change in effective control of a corporation may also occur in any
      transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the
      transaction incurs a change in control event described under
      Section 6.3 or 6.5.




 

Section
6.4  Change in the Ownership of
Substantial Portion of Assets.



 




(a)  


For
      purposes of this Article VI, a change in the ownership of a
      substantial portion of a corporation's assets occurs on the date that any
      one person, or more than one person acting as a group acquires (or has
      acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
      acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the corporation that
      have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent
      of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the
      corporation immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For
      this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the
      corporation, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined
      without regard to any liabilities associated with such
    assets.




 




(b)  


A
      transfer of assets by a corporation shall not be treated as a change in
      the ownership of such assets, and such transfer shall thus not constitute
      a Qualified Change in Control Event, if the assets are transferred
      to:




 




(i)  


A
      shareholder of the corporation (immediately before the asset transfer) in
      exchange for or with respect to its
stock;




 






24









 




(ii)  


An
      entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of
      which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
  corporation;




 




(iii)  


A
      person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or
      indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of
      all the outstanding stock of the corporation;
or




 




(iv)  


An
      entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of
      which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in
      paragraph (iii).




 




(c)  


For
      purposes of subsection (b) above, a person's status is determined
      immediately after the transfer of the assets.  Thus, for
      example, a transfer to a corporation in which the transferor corporation
      has no ownership interest before the transaction, but which is a
      majority-owned subsidiary of the transferor corporation after the
      transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of
      the transferor corporation.




 
Section
6.6  Definitions
and Operating Rules.  The following definitions and operating
rules shall apply for purposes of this Article VI.
 




(a)  


Relevant
      Employer.  To constitute a Qualified Change in Control
      Event as to the particular Participant, the event must relate to one of
      the following corporate employers:




 




(i)  


The
      Company;




 




(ii)  


A
      subsidiary corporate Employer for whom the Participant is performing
      services at the time of the Qualified Change in Control Event;
      or




 




(iii)  


A
      subsidiary corporate Employer that is a majority shareholder of an
      Employer identified in paragraph (ii) above, or any corporate
      Employer in a chain of corporations in which each corporation is a
      majority shareholder of another corporation in the chain, ending in a
      corporation identified in paragraph (ii) above.  For
      purposes of this paragraph (iii), a majority shareholder of a
      corporate Employer is a shareholder owning more than 50% of the total fair
      market value and total voting power of such
  Employer.




 




(b)  


Persons Acting as a
      Group.  Persons will not be considered to be acting as a
      group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same corporation at
      the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However,
      persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a
      corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or
      acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the
      corporation. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both
      corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or
      acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is
      considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a
      corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not
      with respect to the ownership interest in the other
      corporation.




 




(c)  


Ownership
      Attribution.  The ownership attribution rules of Code
      Section 318(a) shall apply to determine stock
      ownership.  Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned
      by the individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an
      unvested option is 





 






25









 




 


not
      considered owned by the individual who holds the unvested
      option).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a
      vested option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested
      (as defined in IRS Regulation § 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock
      underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds
      the option.

DESIGNATION

 
Section
7.1  Beneficiary
Designation. Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to
designate any person, persons or entity as his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. A
Beneficiary designation shall be made, and may be amended, by the Participant by
filing a written designation with the Plan Administration Committee, on such
form and in accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administration Committee
shall establish from time to time.
 
Section
7.2  No
Beneficiary Designation. If a Participant fails to designate a
Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the

ARTICLE
VIII

ADMINISTRATION
OF PLAN

 
Section
8.1 Named
Fiduciaries.  The persons identified in this Section 8.1
are named as fiduciaries under this Plan and shall be the only named fiduciaries
with respect to the Plan.
 




(a)  


The
      Company, as Plan sponsor, shall be responsible for all fiduciary functions
      under the Plan except insofar as any such authority or responsibility is
      assigned by or pursuant to the Plan to another named fiduciary, or is
      delegated to another fiduciary pursuant to subsection (b)
      below.  In that regard, the Company shall be the “Administrator”
      of the Plan within the meaning of ERISA.  The authority and
      responsibility reserved or assigned to the Company shall be exercised by
      its Compensation Committee or other authorized officers, and shall include
      the authority and responsibility in regard to the
    following:




 




(i)  


The
      design of the Plan, including the right to amend and to terminate the
      Plan; and




 




(ii)  


Considering
      and reviewing all appeals of claims which have been
  denied.




 




(b)  


The
      Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee or to any officer of
      the Company or any Affiliated Company any authority or responsibility
      reserved or assigned to the Company pursuant to the Plan.  In
      the event of any such delegation, then any references to the authority,
      right or power of the Company to act which are contained in any notice,
      disclosure or communication made with a view toward effectuating the
      purposes of the Plan shall be construed to include authority for such
      actions by the committee or officer to whom the Compensation Committee has
      delegated its authority.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
      the Plan, in the event that an action or direction of any person to whom
      authority reposed with the Company under the Plan has been delegated by
      the Compensation Committee conflicts with an action or direction of the
      Board of Directors, then the authority of the Compensation Committee shall
      supersede that of the delegate with respect to such action or
      direction.




 




(c)  


A
      Plan Administration Committee shall have the responsibility and authority
      to control the operation and administration of the Plan in accordance with
      the terms of the Plan.




 




(i)  


The
      members of the Plan Administration Committee shall be the individuals
      serving in the roles of, respectively, the Senior Vice President of Human
      Resources and the Vice President, Compensation and Benefits for the
      Employers, and such other individuals who are appointed to the Plan
      Administration Committee by such Senior Vice President of Human Resources
      (or, in the event of a vacancy in such position, by the Vice President,
      Compensation and Benefits).




 




(ii)  


The
      Plan Administration Committee may designate one of its members as a

      take part in any discretionary decision or action affecting his own
      interest as a Participant under this Plan unless such decision or action
      is upon a matter which affects all other Participants similarly situated
      and confers no special right, benefit or privilege not simultaneously
      conferred upon all other such
Participants.




 
Section
8.2  Claim
Procedure.
 




(a)  


If
      a Participant or Beneficiary makes a written request alleging a right to
      receive payments under this Plan or alleging a right to receive an
      adjustment in benefits being paid under this Plan, such actions shall be
      treated as a claim for benefits. All claims for benefits under this Plan
      shall be sent to the Plan Administration
  Committee.




 




(b)  


If
      the Plan Administration Committee determines that any individual who has
      claimed a right to receive benefits, or different benefits, under this
      Plan is not entitled to receive all or any part of the benefits claimed,
      the Plan Administration Committee shall inform the claimant in writing of
      such determination and the reasons thereof in terms calculated to be
      understood by the claimant. The notice shall be sent within 90 days
      of the claim unless the Plan Administration Committee determines that
      additional time, not exceeding 90 days, is needed and so notifies the
      Participant. The notice shall make specific reference to the pertinent
      Plan provisions on which the denial is based, and shall describe any
      additional material or information that is necessary. Such notice shall,
      in addition, inform the claimant of the procedure that the claimant should
      follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the
      event the claimant desires to contest the denial of the claim, and the
      right of the claimant to bring a civil action under ERISA if the claim is
      denied upon further review.  Upon request, and free of charge,
      the claimant will be provided with reasonable access to, and copies of,
      all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim for
      benefits.




 




(c)  


The
      claimant may within 90 days thereafter submit in writing to the Plan
      Administration Committee a notice that the claimant contests the denial of
      his or her claim and desires a further review of the denied
      claim.  The request for review will be directed to the
      Compensation Committee, which will review the claim and authorize the
      claimant to review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments
      relating to the claim. The Compensation Committee will render a final
      decision with specific reasons thereof in writing and will transmit it to
      the claimant within 60 days of the written request for review, unless
      the Compensation Committee determines that additional time, not exceeding
      60 days, is needed, and so notifies the Participant.  If
      the claim is to be denied in whole or in part upon review, the written
      notice to the claimant will include the
  following:




 




(i)  


The
      specific reason or reasons for the
denial;




 






30









 




(ii)  


Reference
      to the specific Plan provisions upon which the denial is
      based;




 




(iii)  


A
      statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, and free
      of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and
      other information relevant to the claim appeal;
  and




 




(iv)  


A
      statement of the claimant’s right to file a civil lawsuit under
      ERISA.




 




(d)  


Notwithstanding
      subsection (c) above, if the Compensation Committee holds regularly
      scheduled meetings at least quarterly, the Compensation Committee shall
      make a claim review determination no later than the date of the meeting of
      the committee that immediately follows the Plan’s receipt of a request for
      review, unless the request for review is filed within 30 days
      preceding the date of such meeting.  In such case, a claim
      review determination may be made by no later than the date of the second
      meeting following the Plan’s receipt of the request for
      review.  If special circumstances (such as the need to hold
      hearing) require a further extension of time for processing, a
      determination shall be rendered not later than the third meeting of the
      committee following the Plan’s receipt of the request for
      review.  If such an extension of time for review is required
      because of special circumstances, the claimant shall be provided with
      written notice of the extension, describing the special circumstances and
      the date as of which the claim review determination will be made, prior to
      the commencement of the extension.  The claimant shall be
      notified of the claim review determination as soon as possible, but not
      later than five days after the determination is
  made.

      actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of
      any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a
      Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law

ADDENDUM
TO
ADVANCE
AUTO PARTS, INC. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
(As
Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2008)

 
PREAMBLE
 
The
purpose and effect of this Addendum (the “Addendum”) to the Advance Auto
Parts, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) is to preserve the
terms of the Plan that were in effect as of December 31, 2004
(the “2004 Plan Terms”), and to continue to apply such 2004 Plan Terms to
compensation deferred under the Plan on or before December 31, 2004,
without regard to the standards of Code Section 409A as enacted under the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”).
 
 
SCOPE OF
ADDENDUM
 
This
Addendum shall apply solely to a Participant’s Deferral Accounts under the Plan
attributable to the deferral of any compensation for services performed by the
Participant for the Company or an Affiliated Company (or for Discount Auto
Parts, Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 2003) on or before
December 31, 2004, provided that the compensation was earned and not
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as of that date.  Such
accounts are hereinafter referred to as “Pre-2005 Deferrals.”  The
accounts maintained for such deferrals are referred to as “Pre-2005 Deferral
Accounts.”
 
For
purposes of greater preciseness, the Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts are those
pertaining to:
 




1.  


A
      Participant’s “Base Salary” Deferrals for 2003 and
  2004;




 




2.  


A
      Participant’s “Quarterly Bonus” Deferrals for 2003 and for the first three
      quarters of 2004;




 




3.  


A
      Participant’s Roll-up Performance Bonus for 2003;
  and




 




4.  


A
      Participant’s DAP SEP Account, as described in Section 4.02 of this
      Addendum.




 
Entitlement
to both the Quarterly Bonus for the fourth quarter of 2004, and for the 2004
Roll-up Performance Bonus, generally required that a Participant have been
employed by the Company as of a post- December 31, 2004 payment
date.  These bonuses, and the underlying deferrals of such bonuses,
were therefore generally subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as of such
date.  Consequently, such bonus deferrals are subject to the Code
Section 409A standards that become effective as of January 1, 2005,
and thus shall be governed by the Basic Plan Document, unless the bonuses were
in fact paid to the applicable Participant on or before December 31,
2004.
 
EFFECT OF AMENDMENTS AND
DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS
 
It is
intended that the 2004 Plan terms be strictly preserved for purposes of this
Addendum.  In that regard, no amendment to the Basic Plan Document,
and no exercise of any discretion by the Plan
Administration  Committee under the terms of the Basic Plan Document,
shall apply to the Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts to which this Addendum pertains
unless such amendment or exercise of discretion expressly provides that it is to
be applied to such Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts.
 






37









 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Plan Administration Committee may change or add a
Hypothetical Investment Benchmarks made available with respect to Pre-2005
Deferral Accounts.

(a)  


Notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this Article III and any Participation
      Agreement, a Participant shall be entitled to elect to withdraw all or
      part of the balance of a Pre-2005 Deferral Account in the event of an
      Unforeseeable Emergency, in accordance with this
      Section 3.09.




 




(b)  


A
      hardship withdrawal pursuant to this Section 3.09 may only be made to
      the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency need,
      and may not be made if such need is or may be relieved (i) through
      reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise; (ii) by
      liquidation of the Participant’s assets to the extent such liquidation
      would not itself cause severe financial hardship; or (iii) by
      cessation of participation in the
Plan.




 




(c)  


An
      application for a hardship withdrawal under this Section 3.09 shall
      be made to the Plan Administration Committee in such form and in
      accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administration Committee shall
      determine from time to time. The determination of whether, and in what
      amount and form, a hardship withdrawal will be permitted pursuant to this
      Section 3.09 shall be made by the Plan Administration
      Committee.




 
Section
3.10
 
Voluntary Early
Withdrawal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article III and any Participation Agreement, a Participant shall be
entitled to elect to withdraw the entire balance of his or her Pre-2005 Deferral
Accounts in accordance with this Section 3.10 by filing with the Plan
Administration Committee such forms, in accordance with such procedures, as the
Plan Administration Committee shall determine from time to time. As soon as
practicable after receipt of such form by the Plan Administration Committee, the
Company shall pay an amount equal to ninety percent of the balance in such
Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts (determined as of the most recent Valuation Date
preceding the date such election is filed) to the electing Participant in a lump
sum in cash, and the Participant shall forfeit the remainder of such Pre-2005
Deferral Accounts.  A Participant who elects to make a voluntary early
withdrawal under this Section 3.10 shall not be entitled to file any
Deferral Agreements under the Plan for post-2004 deferrals pertaining to
compensation to be earned in the first Plan Year that begins after such
voluntary early withdrawal election is made.
 
Section
3.11
 
Change of
Control.  In the event of a Change of Control that is
recommended for approval to the shareholders by the Board, no immediate special
payment shall be made to any Participant and the terms and conditions of the
Plan shall remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Plan to the contrary, upon a hostile Change of Control, the Company
shall immediately pay to each Participant in a lump sum in cash the balance in
the Participant’s Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts (determined as of the most recent
Valuation Date preceding the Change of Control) including any Company Matching
Contributions. A “Hostile Change of Control” is a Change of Control of the
Company (as defined under the terms of the Plan in effect on December 31,
2004), which is not recommended for approval to the shareholders by the
Board.
 






41









 
Section 3.12
 
Company’s Right to
Terminate.  The Board or the Compensation Committee may at any
time terminate the portion of the Plan pertaining to Pre-2005 Deferral Accounts
at any time for any reason, including without limitation if, in its judgment,
the continuance of such portion of the Plan, the tax, accounting, or other
effects thereof, or potential payments thereunder would not be in the best
interests of the Company, and upon any such termination, the Company shall
immediately pay to each Participant in a lump sum the accrued balance in the
Participant’s Pre-2005  Deferral Account (determined as of the most
recent Valuation Date preceding the termination date).
 
 
ARTICLE
IV
 
MERGED
DISCOUNT AUTO PARTS PLAN
 
Section
4.01
 
Overview.  Discount
Auto Parts, Inc. (“Discount Auto Parts”) was acquired by, and is now a
subsidiary of, the Company.  Discount Auto Parts had maintained the
Discount Auto Parts Plan, Inc. Supplemental Executive Profit Sharing Plan (the
“DAP SEP”), a deferred compensation plan, for the benefit of its eligible
employees.  The DAP SEP was merged with and into the Plan, effective
on or about November 1, 2003 (which effective date is hereby referred to as the
“Merger Date”).  For purposes of this Appendix A, a “DAP SEP
Participant” means any current or former employee of Discount Auto Parts for
whom an account was maintained under the DAP SEP as of the Merger
Date.  A DAP SEP Participant is a Participant in the Plan, but only
with respect to the rights associated with the Participant’s DAP SEP Account
established pursuant to Section 4.02 below, unless and to the extent the
individual has become a general Participant in the Plan pursuant to its
terms.
 
Section
4.02
 
Separate DAP SEP
Account.  The value of each DAP SEP Participant’s accrued
benefit under the DAP SEP was transferred to and became a liability of the Plan
as of the Merger Date.  Such amount is maintained in a separate DAP
SEP Account established for the benefit of the DAP SEP Participant.  A
DAP SEP Participant shall at all times be fully vested and have a nonforfeitable
interest in the value of his or her DAP SEP Account.
 
Section
4.03
 
Investment of
Accounts.  A DAP SEP Participant shall be entitled to direct
the manner in which his or her DAP SEP Account will be deemed to be invested by
selecting among the Hypothetical Investment Benchmarks specified from time to
time in Appendix A of the Basic Plan Document.
 
Section
4.04
 
Payment of
Benefits.
 




(a)  


Upon
      a DAP SEP Participant’s termination of employment with the Company and all
      Affiliated Companies, or, if earlier, upon such Participant’s attainment
      of age 65 (the “Normal Retirement Age” under the DAP SEP), the DAP SEP
      Participant shall become 




 






42










 




  


entitled
      to receive payment of the value of the balance of his or her DAP SEP
      Account determined as of the date of such event.  Payment of
      such benefit shall be made in a lump sum within 120 days after the
      occurrence of the event giving rise to the DAP SEP Participant’s right to
      receive payment.




 





(b)  


A
      DAP SEP Participant shall not be entitled to elect to receive any portion
      of his or her DAP SEP Account prior to terminating employment or attaining
      age 65.  Consequently, the Specified Time distribution,
      hardship withdrawal and voluntary early withdrawal provisions of
      Article III of this Addendum shall not apply to a Participant’s DAP
      SEP Account.




 




(c)  


The
      timing of the payment of a Participant’s DAP SEP Account shall not be
      affected by the timing of any other benefits that the DAP SEP Participant
      may be entitled to receive as a general Participant in the
      Plan.




 
Section
4.05
 
Death
Benefits.  Any beneficiary designation filed under the DAP SEP
by a DAP SEP Participant whose death had occurred prior to the Merger Date
became null and void as of the Merger date.  Accordingly, a DAP SEP
Participant who is not a general Participant in the Plan as of the Merger Date
may designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as generally prescribed under the
Plan.  In the event of the DAP SEP Participant’s death prior to
payment of his or her DAP SEP Account, the Participant’s interest in that
Account shall be paid to the Participant’s Beneficiary as designated or
prescribed under the Plan.
