Forward-Looking Statements
We have included in or incorporated by reference into this report, and from time to time may make in our public filings, press releases or other public statements, certain statements, including (without limitation) those under “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.
The nature of our business makes predicting the future trends of our revenues, expenses and net income difficult. The risks and uncertainties involved in our businesses could affect the matters referred to in such statements, and it is possible that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include (without limitation):
 
 	•	 	
the effect of economic and political conditions and geopolitical events, including the United Kingdom’s (the “U.K.”) anticipated withdrawal from the European Union (the “E.U.”);
 	•	 	
sovereign risk;
 	•	 	
the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income, currency, credit and commodities markets, including corporate and mortgage (commercial and residential) lending and commercial real estate markets and energy markets;
 	•	 	
the impact of current, pending and future legislation (including with respect to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)) or changes thereto, regulation (including capital, leverage, funding, liquidity and tax requirements), policies (including fiscal and monetary policies established by central banks and financial regulators, and changes to global trade policies), and other legal and regulatory actions in the United States of America (“U.S.”) and worldwide;
 	•	 	
the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), interest rates, currency values and other market indices;
 	•	 	
the availability and cost of both credit and capital as well as the credit ratings assigned to our unsecured short-term and long-term debt;
 	•	 	
investor, consumer and business sentiment and confidence in the financial markets;
 	•	 	
the performance and results of our acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other strategic arrangements;
 	•	 	
our reputation and the general perception of the financial services industry;
 	•	 	
inflation, natural disasters, pandemics and acts of war or terrorism;
 	•	 	
the actions and initiatives of current and potential competitors as well as governments, central banks, regulators and self-regulatory organizations;
 	•	 	
the effectiveness of our risk management policies;
 	•	 	
technological changes instituted by us, our competitors or counterparties and technological risks, including cybersecurity, business continuity and related operational risks;
 	•	 	
our ability to provide innovative products and services and execute our strategic objectives; and
 	•	 	
other risks and uncertainties detailed under “Business—Competition” and “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere throughout this report.
Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law. You should, however, consult further disclosures we may make in future filings of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments thereto or in future press releases or other public statements.

Part I
Item  1. Business
Overview
We are a global financial services firm that, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, advises, and originates, trades, manages and distributes capital for, governments, institutions and individuals. We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1981, and our predecessor companies date back to 1924. We are a financial holding company (“FHC”) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). We conduct our business from our headquarters in and around New York City, our regional offices and branches throughout the U.S. and our principal offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other world financial centers. As of December 31, 2016, we had 55,311 employees worldwide. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Morgan Stanley,” the “Firm,” “us,” “we,” and “our” mean Morgan Stanley (the “Parent Company”) together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
Financial information concerning us, our business segments and geographic regions for each of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 is included in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.
Business Segments
We are a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of our business segments—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we provide a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Additional information related to our business segments, respective clients, and products and services provided is included under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.
Competition
All aspects of our businesses are highly competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete in the U.S. and globally for clients, market share and human talent. Operating within the financial services industry on a global basis presents, among other things, technological, risk management, regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that
require effective resource allocation in order for us to remain competitive. Our competitive position depends on our reputation and the quality and consistency of our long-term investment performance. Our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs. We compete with commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the U.S., globally and through the internet. In addition, restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain U.S. financial services institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, which may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions and impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements. See also “—Supervision and Regulation” below and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Institutional Securities and Wealth Management
Our competitive position for our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments depends on innovation, execution capability and relative pricing. We compete directly in the U.S. and globally with other securities and financial services firms and broker-dealers and with others on a regional or product basis. Additionally, there is increased competition driven by established firms as well as the emergence of new firms and business models (including innovative uses of technology) competing for the same clients and assets or offering similar products and services.
Our ability to access capital at competitive rates (which is generally impacted by our credit ratings), to commit and to deploy capital efficiently, particularly in our capital-intensive underwriting and sales, trading, financing and market-making activities, also affects our competitive position. Corporate clients may request that we provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities and such requests are expected to continue.
It is possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial institutions that may be larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure on our businesses. In addition, our business is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and abroad, while certain of our competitors may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage.

We continue to experience intense price competition in some of our businesses. In particular, the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions and comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely increase as additional trading moves to more automated platforms. It is also possible that we will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices (in the form of commissions or pricing).
Investment Management
Our ability to compete successfully in the asset management industry is affected by several factors, including our reputation, investment objectives, quality of investment professionals, performance of investment strategies or product offerings relative to peers and appropriate benchmark indices, advertising and sales promotion efforts, fee levels, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels and investment pipelines, and the types and quality of products offered. Our investment products, including alternative investment products, may compete with investments offered by other investment managers with passive investment products or who may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than us.
Supervision and Regulation
As a major financial services firm, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business. Moreover, in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, legislators and regulators, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have adopted, continue to propose or are in the process of implementing a wide range of reforms that have resulted or that may in the future result in major changes to the way we are regulated and conduct our business. These reforms include the Dodd-Frank Act; risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards adopted or being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), including Basel III, and the national implementation of those standards; capital planning and stress testing requirements; and new resolution regimes that are being developed in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. While certain portions of these reforms are effective, others are still subject to final rulemaking or transition periods.
We continue to monitor the changing political, tax and regulatory environment; it is likely that there will be further material changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the U.S. and other markets in which we operate,
although it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period.
Financial Holding Company
Consolidated Supervision.    We have operated as a bank holding company and FHC under the BHC Act since September 2008. As a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under existing regulation, the Federal Reserve has heightened authority to examine, prescribe regulations and take action with respect to all of our subsidiaries. In particular, we are, or will become, subject to (among other things): significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision; more intensive scrutiny of our businesses and plans for expansion of those businesses; new activities limitations; a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements; restrictions on activities and investments imposed by a section of the BHC Act added by the Dodd-Frank Act referred to as the “Volcker Rule”; and comprehensive derivatives regulation. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has primary rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority over us and our subsidiaries with respect to federal consumer protection laws, to the extent applicable.
Scope of Permitted Activities.    The BHC Act limits the activities of bank holding companies and financial holding companies and grants the Federal Reserve authority to limit our ability to conduct activities. We must obtain the Federal Reserve’s approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both in the U.S. and internationally. Since becoming a bank holding company, we have disposed of certain nonconforming assets and conformed certain activities to the requirements of the BHC Act.
The BHC Act grandfathers “activities related to the trading, sale or investment in commodities and underlying physical properties,” provided that we were engaged in “any of such activities as of September 30, 1997 in the United States” and provided that certain other conditions that are within our reasonable control are satisfied. We currently engage in our commodities activities pursuant to the BHC Act grandfather exemption as well as other authorities under the BHC Act.
Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule.    The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including the Firm and its affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of
 
 
December 2016 Form 10-K	 	2	 	
Table of Contents

 	LOGO
 
exemptions and exclusions. Banking entities were required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. For more information about the conformance periods applicable to certain covered funds, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Developments.” In addition, the Volcker Rule requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.
The Volcker Rule also requires that deductions be made from a bank holding company’s Tier 1 capital for certain permissible investments in covered funds. Beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2015, the required deductions are reflected in our relevant regulatory capital tiers and ratios. Given its complexity, the full impact of the Volcker Rule is still uncertain and will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the five regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight.
Capital Standards.    The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for large bank holding companies and evaluates our compliance with such requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”).
Regulatory Capital Framework.    The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for large bank holding companies, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. After completion of certain transitional arrangements in the regulatory capital framework, we will be subject to various risk-based capital requirements, measured against our Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital bases, leverage-based capital requirements, including the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, and additional capital buffers above generally applicable minimum standards for bank holding companies.
The Basel Committee is in the process of considering revisions to various provisions of the capital framework that, if adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, could result in substantial changes to our regulatory capital framework.
Regulated Subsidiaries.    In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are, or are expected to be in the future, subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as “swap dealers” with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) or “security-based swap dealers” with the SEC (collectively, “Swaps Entities”) or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. Specific regulatory capital requirements vary by regulated subsidiary, and in many cases these standards are not yet established or are subject to ongoing rulemakings that could substantially modify requirements.
Commodities-Related Capital Requirements.    In September 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rulemaking that would increase risk-based capital requirements for certain commodities-related activities and commodities-related merchant banking investments of U.S. FHCs, including the Firm; impose new limitations on the physical commodity trading activities of certain U.S. FHCs; and enhance reporting requirements with respect to U.S. FHCs’ commodities-related activities and investments. If adopted in its current form, the proposed rulemaking would result in increases in our risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) with respect to certain commodities-related investments and physical commodity holdings. However, we expect that the proposed rule, if finalized in its proposed form, would not have a material impact on our aggregate RWAs or risk-based capital ratios.
For more information about the specific capital requirements applicable to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.
Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Capital Distributions.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including Morgan Stanley. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. For more information about the capital planning and stress test requirements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.
In addition to capital planning requirements, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. All of these

 	LOGO
 
policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock, or require us to provide capital assistance to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under circumstances which we would not otherwise decide to do so.
Liquidity Standards.    In addition to capital regulations, the U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee have adopted, or are in the process of considering, liquidity standards. The Basel Committee has developed two standards intended for use in liquidity risk supervision, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”). The Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements issued by the U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. LCR”) and would be subject to the NSFR requirements proposed by the U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. NSFR”).
In addition to the U.S. LCR and U.S. NSFR, we and many of our regulated subsidiaries, including those registered as Swaps Entities with the CFTC or SEC, are, or are expected to be in the future, subject to other liquidity standards, including liquidity stress-testing and associated liquidity reserve requirements.
For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Liquidity Framework” in Part II, Item 7.
Systemic Risk Regime.    The Dodd-Frank Act established a systemic risk regime to which bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, such as Morgan Stanley, are subject. Under rules issued by the Federal Reserve to implement certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards, such bank holding companies must conduct internal liquidity stress tests, maintain unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30 days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in internal stress tests, and comply with various liquidity risk management requirements. Institutions also must comply with a range of risk management and corporate governance requirements.
In March 2016, the Federal Reserve re-proposed rules that would establish single-counterparty credit limits for large banking organizations (“covered companies”), with more stringent limits for the largest covered companies. U.S. global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), including the Firm, would be subject to a limit of 15% of Tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any “major counterparty” (defined as other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and nonbank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve) and to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital for credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed rules that would create a new early remediation framework to address financial distress or material management weaknesses. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish additional prudential standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures. For example, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and Long-Term Debt Requirement” in Part II, Item 7.
Under the systemic risk regime, if the Federal Reserve or the Financial Stability Oversight Council determines that a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets poses a “grave threat” to U.S. financial stability, the institution may be, among other things, restricted in its ability to merge or offer financial products and required to terminate activities and dispose of assets.
See also “—Capital Standards” and “—Liquidity Standards” herein and “—Resolution and Recovery Planning” below.
Resolution and Recovery Planning.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is a single point of entry (“SPOE”) strategy. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of additional capital and liquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy after the Parent Company has filed for bankruptcy.
Further, we are required to submit an annual recovery plan to the Federal Reserve that outlines the steps that management could take over time to generate or conserve financial resources in times of prolonged financial stress.
Certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are also subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, MSBNA must submit to the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes MSBNA’s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of MSBNA. In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national banks and certain other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines were effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be in compliance by January 1, 2018.

In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as the Firm and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed as receiver, provided that certain procedures are met, including certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in consultation with the U.S. President. The orderly liquidation authority rulemaking is proceeding in stages, with some regulations now finalized and others not yet proposed. If we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable powers, including: the power to remove directors and officers responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers; the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; the ability to differentiate among our creditors, including by treating certain creditors within the same class better than others, subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership. The FDIC has been developing an SPOE strategy that could be used to implement the orderly liquidation authority.
Regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes. For more information about our resolution plan-related submissions and associated regulatory actions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Developments—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part II, Item 7.
Cyber Risk Management.    As a general matter, the financial services industry faces increased regulatory focus regarding cyber risk management practices. In October 2016, the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including the Firm. The proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector.
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.    MSBNA, primarily a wholesale commercial bank, offers commercial lending and certain retail securities-based lending services in addition to deposit products, and also conducts certain foreign exchange activities.
MSPBNA offers certain mortgage and other secured lending products, including retail securities-based lending products, primarily for customers of our affiliate retail broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB LLC”). MSPBNA also offers certain deposit products and prime brokerage custody services.
Both MSBNA and MSPBNA are FDIC-insured national banks subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC. They are both subject to the OCC’s risk governance guidelines, which establish heightened standards for a large national bank’s risk governance framework and the oversight of that framework by the bank’s board of directors.
Prompt Corrective Action.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by their federal banking regulators. Among other things, it requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Current PCA regulations generally apply only to insured banks and thrifts such as MSBNA or MSPBNA and not to their parent holding companies. The Federal Reserve is, however, authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, subject to certain limitations. Under the systemic risk regime, as described above, we also would become subject to an early remediation protocol in the event of financial distress. In addition, bank holding companies, such as Morgan Stanley, are required to serve as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and commit resources to support these subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries are in financial distress.
Transactions with Affiliates.    Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which impose restrictions on “covered transactions” with any affiliates. Covered transactions include any extension of credit to, purchase of assets from, and certain other transactions by insured banks with an affiliate. These restrictions limit the total amount of credit exposure that our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries may have to any one affiliate and to all affiliates. Other provisions set collateral requirements and require all such transactions to be made on market terms. Derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates are

 	LOGO
 
subject to these restrictions. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will propose a rulemaking to implement these more recent restrictions.
In addition, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits covered transactions between (i) us or any of our affiliates and (ii) covered funds for which we or any of our affiliates serves as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, or other covered funds organized and offered by us or any of our affiliates pursuant to specific exemptions in the Volcker Rule. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Activities Restriction under the Volcker Rule” above.
FDIC Regulation.    An FDIC-insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an insured depository institution under common control by the same bank holding company. As commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions, each of MSBNA and MSPBNA could be responsible for any loss to the FDIC from the failure of the other. In addition, both institutions are exposed to changes in the cost of FDIC insurance. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, some of the restoration of the FDIC’s reserve fund must be paid for exclusively by large depository institutions, including MSBNA.
Institutional Securities and Wealth Management
Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation.    Our primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS&Co.”) and MSSB LLC, are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are members of various self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), and various securities exchanges and clearing organizations. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure, risk management controls in connection with market access, recordkeeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers, representatives and other associated persons. Broker-dealers are also regulated by securities administrators in those states where they do business. Violations of the laws and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer or its officers or employees, or other similar consequences by both federal and state securities administrators. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides certain protections for customers of broker-dealers against losses in the event of the insolvency of a broker-dealer.
MSSB LLC is also a registered investment adviser with the SEC. MSSB LLC’s relationship with its investment advisory clients is subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed on investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as various state securities laws. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance, including the power to restrict or limit MSSB LLC from carrying on its investment advisory and other asset management activities. Other sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.
The Firm is subject to various regulations that affect broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is authorized to impose a fiduciary duty rule applicable to broker-dealers when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail customers, although the SEC has not yet acted on this authority.
As a separate matter, in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor adopted a conflict of interest rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that broadens the circumstances under which a firm and/or financial adviser is considered a fiduciary when providing certain recommendations to retirement investors and requires that such recommendations be in the best interests of clients. Subject to any potential delays, the new fiduciary standard for investment advice has a scheduled applicability date of April 10, 2017, with certain aspects subject to phased-in compliance, and with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. Given the breadth and scale of our platform and continued investment in technology and infrastructure, we believe that we will be able to provide compliant solutions to meet our clients’ investment needs. However, these developments may impact the manner in which affected businesses are conducted, decrease profitability and increase potential litigation or enforcement risk.
Margin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserve’s restrictions on lending in connection with customer and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers are also subject to maintenance and other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules. In many cases, our broker-dealer subsidiaries’ margin policies are more stringent than these rules.
As registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s net capital rule and the net capital requirements of various exchanges, other regulatory author-

ities and self-regulatory organizations. These rules are generally designed to measure the broker-dealer subsidiary’s general financial integrity and/or liquidity and require that at least a minimum amount of net and/or liquid assets be maintained by the subsidiary. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Consolidated Supervision” and “—Financial Holding Company—Liquidity Standards” above. Rules of FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose limitations and requirements on the transfer of member organizations’ assets.
Research.    Both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators continue to focus on research conflicts of interest. Research-related regulations have been implemented in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S. where FINRA has adopted rules that cover both equity and debt. New and revised requirements resulting from these regulations and the global research settlement with U.S. federal and state regulators (to which we are a party) have necessitated the development or enhancement of corresponding policies and procedures.
Regulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities.    MS&Co., as a futures commission merchant, and MSSB LLC, as an introducing broker, are subject to net capital requirements of, and certain of their activities are regulated by, the CFTC, the National Futures Association (the “NFA”), CME Group, and various commodity futures exchanges. MS&Co. and MSSB LLC and certain of their affiliates are registered members of the NFA in various capacities. Rules and regulations of the CFTC, NFA and commodity futures exchanges address obligations related to, among other things, customer protections, the segregation of customer funds and the holding of secured amounts, the use by futures commission merchants of customer funds, recordkeeping and reporting obligations of futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers, risk disclosure, risk management and discretionary trading.
Our commodities activities are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety, and other governmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. Intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by U.S. federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and by the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement and remedial proceedings involving companies conducting the activities in which we are engaged. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Scope of Permitted Activities” and “—Capital Standards—Commodities-Related Capital Requirements” above.
Derivatives Regulation.    Under the U.S. regulatory regime for “swaps” and “security-based swaps” (collectively, “Swaps”) implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we
are subject to regulations including, among others, public and regulatory reporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution facilities for certain types of Swaps. While the CFTC has completed the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect, the SEC has not yet adopted a number of its Swaps regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the registration of “swap dealers” with the CFTC and “security-based swap dealers” with the SEC. Certain of our subsidiaries have registered with the CFTC as swap dealers and will in the future be required to register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. Such Swaps Entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime with new obligations for the Swaps activities for which they are registered, including capital requirements, margin requirements for uncleared Swaps and comprehensive business conduct rules. Each of the CFTC and the SEC have proposed rules to impose capital standards on Swaps Entities subject to their respective jurisdictions, which include our subsidiaries, but these rules have not yet been finalized.
The specific parameters of some of these requirements for Swaps have been and continue to be developed through the CFTC, SEC and bank regulator rulemakings. In 2015, the federal banking regulators and the CFTC separately issued final rules establishing uncleared Swap margin requirements for Swaps Entities subject to their respective regulation, including MSBNA, Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”), respectively. These final rules impose variation margin requirements under a phase-in compliance schedule that applied to the largest dealers as of September 1, 2016 and will apply to the remainder of in-scope market participants as of March 1, 2017. Similarly, the final rules phase-in initial margin requirements from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2020, depending on the level of over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives activity of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Margin rules with the same or similar compliance dates have been adopted or are in the process of being finalized by regulators outside the U.S. and certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to such rules.
Although the full impact of global derivatives regulation on us remains unclear, we have already faced, and are expected to continue to face, increased costs and regulatory oversight due to the registration and regulatory requirements indicated above. Complying with the Swaps rules also has required, and is expected to in the future require, us to change our Swaps businesses and has required, and may in the future require, extensive systems and personnel changes. Compliance with Swaps-related regulatory capital requirements may require us to devote more capital to our Swaps business.

Non-U.S. Regulation.    Our Institutional Securities businesses also are regulated extensively by non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, commodity exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. In addition, certain Morgan Stanley subsidiaries are regulated as broker-dealers under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries engaged in banking and trust activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For instance, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”), the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and several securities and futures exchanges in the U.K., including the London Stock Exchange and ICE Futures Europe, regulate our activities in the U.K.; the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) and the Deutsche Börse AG regulate our activities in the Federal Republic of Germany; the Financial Services Agency, the Bank of Japan, the Japanese Securities Dealers Association and several Japanese securities and futures exchanges, regulate our activities in Japan; the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited regulate our operations in Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Limited regulate our business in Singapore.
Our largest non-U.S. entity, MSIP, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the PRA, which has broad legal authority to establish prudential and other standards applicable to MSIP that seek to ensure its safety and soundness and to minimize adverse effects on the stability of the U.K. financial system. MSIP is also regulated and supervised by the FCA with respect to business conduct matters.
Non-U.S. policymakers and regulators, including the European Commission and European Supervisory Authorities (among others, the European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority), continue to propose and adopt numerous reforms, including those that may further impact the structure of banks, and to formulate regulatory standards and measures that will be of relevance and importance to our European operations. In November 2016, the European Commission published proposals that would require certain large, non-E.U. financial groups with two or more institutions established in the E.U., to establish a single E.U. intermediate holding company (“IHC”). The proposals would require E.U. banks and broker-dealers to be held below the E.U. IHC; until more specific regulations are proposed, it remains unclear which other E.U. entities would need to be held beneath the E.U. IHC. The E.U. IHC would be subject to: direct supervision and authorization by the European Central Bank or the relevant national E.U. regu-
lator; the E.U. bank recovery and resolution regime under the E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (“BRRD”); and capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential standards on a consolidated basis. The proposals will now be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. The final form of the proposals, as well as the date of their adoption, is not yet certain.
Regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions have also finalized or are in the process of proposing or finalizing risk-based capital, leverage capital, liquidity, market-based reforms and other regulatory standards applicable to certain of our subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For instance, European Market Infrastructure Regulation introduces new requirements regarding the central clearing and reporting of derivatives, as well as margin requirements for uncleared derivatives. The Markets in Financial Instrument Regulation and a revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (together, “MiFID II”), which is now scheduled to take effect on January 3, 2018, will also introduce comprehensive and new trading and market infrastructure reforms in the E.U., including new trading venues, enhancements to pre- and post-trading transparency, and additional investor protection requirements, among others. Although the full impact of these changes remains unclear, complying with MiFID II is expected to require extensive changes to our operations, including systems and controls.
Regulators in the U.K., E.U. and other major jurisdictions have also finalized or are in the process of proposing or finalizing recovery and resolution planning frameworks and related regulatory requirements that will apply to certain of our subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions. For instance, the BRRD has established a recovery and resolution framework for E.U. credit institutions and investment firms, including MSIP. E.U. Member States were required to apply provisions implementing the BRRD as of January 1, 2015, subject to certain exemptions. In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity.
Investment Management
Many of the subsidiaries engaged in our asset management activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Many aspects of our asset management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us

 	LOGO
 
from carrying on our asset management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for such failure include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our engaging in various asset management activities for specified periods of time or specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines. In order to facilitate our asset management business, we own a registered U.S. broker-dealer, Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc., which acts as distributor to the Morgan Stanley mutual funds and as placement agent to certain private investment funds managed by our Investment Management business segment. In addition, certain of our affiliates are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators, or are operating under certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance, and have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they advise. Violations of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions, including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships. See also “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation,” “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Regulation of Futures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities,” “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Derivatives Regulation” and “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Non-U.S. Regulation” above for a discussion of other regulations that impact our Investment Management business, including, among other things, the Department of Labor’s conflict of interest rule and MiFID II.
As a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, our asset management activities are subject to certain additional laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements (including with respect to clients that are private funds) and restrictions on sponsoring or investing in, or maintaining certain other relationships with, “covered funds,” as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to certain limited exemptions. Many of these requirements may increase the expenses associated with our asset management activities and/or reduce the investment returns we are able to generate for our asset management clients. See also “—Financial Holding Company—Activities Restrictions under the Volcker Rule” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Developments.”
Our Investment Management business is also regulated outside the U.S. For example, the FCA is the primary regulator of our business in the U.K.; the Financial Services Agency regulates our business in Japan; the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong regulates our business in
Hong Kong; and the Monetary Authority of Singapore regulates our business in Singapore. See also “—Institutional Securities and Wealth Management—Non-U.S. Regulation” herein.
Financial Crimes Program
Our Financial Crimes program is coordinated on an enterprise-wide basis and supports our financial crime prevention efforts across all regions and business units with responsibility for governance, oversight and execution of our Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”), economic sanctions (“Sanctions”) and anti-corruption programs.
In the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and mutual funds to implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Outside the U.S., applicable laws, rules and regulations similarly require designated types of financial institutions to implement AML programs. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. Regarding Sanctions, we have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which target foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to U.S. foreign policy, national security or economic interests, and to comply, as applicable, similar sanctions programs imposed by foreign governments or global or regional multilateral organizations such as the United Nations Security Council and the E.U. Council.
We are also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.

Protection of Client Information
Many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer information, including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., the E.U. Data Protection Directive and various laws in Asia, including the Japanese Personal Information (Protection) Law, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Protection) Ordinance and the Australian Privacy Act. We have adopted measures designed to comply with these and related applicable requirements in all relevant jurisdictions.
Compensation Practices and Other Regulation
Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies worldwide. In particular, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s guidance that is designed to help ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The scope and content of the Federal Reserve’s policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and may change based on findings from its peer review process, and we expect that these policies will evolve over a number of years.
We are subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which may impact our compensation practices. In 2016, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, certain federal regulatory agencies reproposed a rule, which, if implemented as written, would require, among other things, the deferral of a percentage of certain incentive-based compensation for senior executives and certain other employees and, under certain circumstances, “clawback” of incentive-based compensation. In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2015, the SEC proposed rules that would direct stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and would also require companies to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies. We continue to evaluate the proposed rules, both of which are subject to further rulemaking procedures.
Our compensation practices may also be impacted by regulations in other jurisdictions. Our compensation practices with respect to certain employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of our E.U. operations are subject to the Capital Requirements Directive IV (the “CRD IV”) and related E.U. and Member State regulations, including, among others, a cap on the ratio of variable remuneration to fixed
remuneration and clawback arrangements in relation to variable remuneration paid in the past. In the U.K., the remuneration of certain employees of banks and other firms is governed by the Remuneration Code of the FCA and by the PRA Rulebook (Remuneration Part), including provisions that implement the CRD IV, as well as additional U.K. requirements.
For a discussion of certain risks relating to our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and strategic objectives, see “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and “Return on Equity Target” and “Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.
Market Risk
Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global and economic conditions and other factors, including changes in asset values.
Our results of operations have been in the past and may, in the future, be materially affected by market fluctuations due to global financial markets, economic conditions, changes to the global trade policies and other factors, including the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), interest rates, currency values and other market indices. The results of our Institutional Securities business segment, particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in new business flows and in the fair value of securities and other financial products. Fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity, which, among other things, affects the size, number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments. During periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets, as well as the level of client assets, may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our Wealth Management business segment. In addition, fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management or supervision and the way customers allocate capital among
money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our Investment Management business segment.
The value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets make it extremely difficult to value certain of our financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective performance-based fees (also known as incentive fees or carried interest) in respect of certain business. In addition, at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.
In addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale. Our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.
Holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses.
Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market-making, investing, block trading, underwriting and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements, or when market conditions are more favorable for our competitors. We commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses, which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of, or making large loans to, a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry, country or region. For further information regarding our country risk exposure, see also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk—Country Risk Exposure” in Item 7A.

Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. For more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
We are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations.
We incur significant credit risk exposure through our Institutional Securities business segment. This risk may arise from a variety of business activities, including but not limited to extending credit to clients through various lending commitments; entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us; providing short or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount; posting margin and/or collateral and other commitments to clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties; and investing and trading in securities and loan pools whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.
We also incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment lending to mainly individual investors, including, but not limited to, margin and securities-based loans collateralized by securities, residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.
While we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk, adverse economic conditions may negatively impact our clients and our current credit exposures. In addition, as a clearing member of several central counterparties, we finance our customer positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers. Although we regularly review our credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
A default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets.
The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships among the institutions. For example, increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges as required by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. As a
result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks and securities firms, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. See also “Systemic Risk Regime” under “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company” in Part I, Item 1.
Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). Legal, regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk.” For more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Operational Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
We are subject to operational risks, including a failure, breach or other disruption of our operational or security systems, that could adversely affect our businesses or reputation.
Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. In some of our businesses, the transactions we process are complex. In addition, we may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting, including in connection with new regulatory requirements, resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in using increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades. We perform the functions required to operate our different businesses either by ourselves or through agreements with third parties. We rely on the ability of our employees, our internal systems and systems at technology centers operated by unaffiliated third parties to process a high volume of transactions. Additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection, which may differ, and potentially conflict, in various jurisdictions.

As a major participant in the global capital markets, we maintain extensive controls to reduce the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data, models, electronic trading systems or processes or due to fraud. Nevertheless, such risk cannot be completely eliminated.
We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending. securities and derivatives transactions. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our or a third party’s systems or improper or unauthorized action by third parties or our employees, we could suffer financial loss, an impairment to our liquidity, a disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. In addition, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business.
Despite the business contingency plans we have in place, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to us. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located, which are concentrated in the New York metropolitan area, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo as well as Mumbai, Budapest, Glasgow and Baltimore. This may include a disruption involving physical site access, cyber incidents, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, catastrophic events, natural disasters, extreme weather events, electrical outage, environmental hazard, computer servers, communications or other services we use, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.
Although we devote significant resources to maintaining and upgrading our systems and networks with measures such as intrusion prevention and detection systems, monitoring firewalls and network traffic to safeguard critical business applications, and supervising third party providers that have access to our systems, there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide absolute security given the techniques used in cyber attacks are complex and frequently change, and may not be able to be anticipated. Like other financial services firms, the Firm and its third party providers continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse of information, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage
systems or cause other damage, denial of service attacks and other events. These threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, including third party providers, or may result from accidental technological failure. Additional challenges are posed by external extremist parties, including foreign state actors, in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends. Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, clients, third parties or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale.
If one or more of these events occur, it could result in a security impact on our systems and jeopardize our or our clients’, partners’ or counterparties’ personal, confidential, proprietary or other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our and our third party providers’ computer systems. Furthermore, such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, partners’, counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in reputational damage with our clients and the market, client dissatisfaction, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, or regulatory fines or penalties, all or any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of clients, partners and counterparties with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.
While many of our agreements with partners and third party vendors include indemnification provisions, we may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to adequately offset any losses. In addition, although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.

Liquidity and Funding Risk
Liquidity and funding risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity and funding risk encompasses the risk that our financial condition or overall soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. It also includes the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may cause unexpected changes in funding needs or an inability to raise new funding. For more information on how we monitor and manage liquidity and funding risk, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Liquidity and Funding Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
Liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations.
Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or our inability to access the secured lending markets. Factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and other geographic areas, could impair our ability to raise funding.
In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the rating agencies, a decline in the level of our business activity, or if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or our industry, or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity. If we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above, we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our investment portfolios or trading assets, to meet maturing liabilities. We may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings.
The cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by our short-term and long-term credit ratings. The
rating agencies continue to monitor certain issuer specific factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings, including governance, the level and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding, risk appetite and management, asset quality, strategic direction, and business mix. Additionally, the rating agencies will look at other industry-wide factors such as regulatory or legislative changes, including, for example, regulatory changes, macro-economic environment, and perceived levels of third party support, and it is possible that they could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions.
Our credit ratings also can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC and other derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral to, or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with, certain counterparties in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. Termination of our trading and other agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. The additional collateral or termination payments which may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Ratings—Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments upon Potential Future Rating Downgrade” in Part II, Item 7.
We are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.
The Parent Company has no operations and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations and self-regulatory organization rules that limit, as well as authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce, the flow of funds to the Parent Company, or that prohibit such transfers or dividends altogether in certain circumstances, including steps to “ring fence” entities by regulators outside of the U.S. to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of

financial difficulties involving such entities. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. The OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have the authority, and under certain circumstances the duty, to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.
Our liquidity and financial condition have in the past been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by U.S. and international markets and economic conditions.
Our ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or the equity markets, or to access secured lending markets, has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international markets and economies. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. In particular, our cost and availability of funding in the past have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Significant turbulence in the U.S., the E.U. and other international markets and economies could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us.
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk
Legal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation we may suffer as a result of our failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, anti-corruption and terrorist financing rules and regulations. For more information on how we monitor and manage legal, regulatory and compliance risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Legal and Compliance Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, and changes in regulation will impact our business.
Like other major financial services firms, we are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by regulators and
exchanges in each of the major markets where we conduct our business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way we do business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments.
The regulation of major financial firms, including the Firm, as well as of the markets in which we operate, is extensive and subject to ongoing change. We are, or will become, subject to (among other things) wide-ranging regulation and supervision, intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses, limitations on new activities, a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards, resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements, new requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of external total loss-absorbing capacity and external long-term debt, restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the Volcker Rule, comprehensive derivatives regulation, tax regulations, antitrust laws, trade and transaction reporting obligations, and broadened fiduciary obligations. In some areas, regulatory standards have not yet been finalized, are subject to final rulemaking or transition periods or may otherwise be revised in whole or in part. Ongoing implementation of, or changes in, laws and regulations could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional costs, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock, or require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. In addition, regulatory requirements that are being imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S. and may adversely affect us. We expect legal and regulatory requirements to be subject to ongoing change for the foreseeable future, which may result in significant new costs to comply with new or revised requirements as well as to monitor for compliance on an ongoing basis.
The application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the United States or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders, and subject us to other restrictions.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC an annual resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our annual resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any defi-

ciencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities, or operations, or after a two year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.
In addition, provided that certain procedures are met, we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act with the FDIC being appointed as receiver. The FDIC’s power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances, subject to certain limitations, could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt. See “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in Part II, Item 7.
Further, because both our resolution plan contemplates a an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC has proposed an SPOE strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers, we believe that the application of an SPOE strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of additional capital and liquidity by the Parent Company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy, and the Parent Company expects to enter into an amended and restated secured support agreement with its material subsidiaries pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity.
Under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, including one in which an SPOE strategy is used, the Parent Company will be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany payables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to its material subsidiaries. The obligations of the Parent Company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) will be effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company. Such unsecured obligations would be at risk of absorbing losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. Although an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution
proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority, is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall, there is no guarantee that the application of an SPOE strategy, including the provision of support to the Parent Company’s material subsidiaries pursuant to the amended and restated secured support agreement, will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared to a different resolution strategy for the firm.
Regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes. For example, the Federal Reserve has issued a final rule that requires top-tier bank holding companies of U.S. G-SIBs, including Morgan Stanley, to maintain minimum amounts of equity and eligible long-term debt (“total loss-absorbing capacity” or “TLAC”) in order to ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the TLAC final rule is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of our operating subsidiaries or before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk.
In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity. Such “bail-in” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors. Non-U.S. regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent Company in the event of failure.
We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital standards.
We are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, which requires us to submit, on an annual basis, a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders,

 	LOGO
 
proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities, and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take. The Federal Reserve may object to, or otherwise require us to modify, such plan, or may object or require modifications to a resubmitted capital plan, any of which would adversely affect shareholders. In addition, beyond review of the plan, the Federal Reserve may impose other restrictions or conditions on us that prevent us from paying or increasing dividends, repurchasing securities or taking other capital actions that would benefit shareholders. Finally, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions, or may modify or impose other regulatory standards that increase our operating expenses and reduce our ability to take capital actions.
The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations, and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability.
As a global financial services firm, we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business. Investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the monetary consequences, these measures could, for example, impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses. The number of these investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, has increased substantially in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry, including the Firm, and certain U.S. and international governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions, pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from, financial institutions. Significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the SEC or CFTC with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action. As a result of this compensation, it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by the SEC or CFTC.
We have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal or regulatory
actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, or may result in penalties, fines, or other results adverse to us. In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. In other cases, including antitrust litigation, we may be subject to claims for joint and several liability with other defendants for treble damages or other relief related to alleged conspiracies involving other institutions. Like any large corporation, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information, or improper sales practices or conduct.
We may be responsible for representations and warranties associated with residential and commercial real estate loans and may incur losses in excess of our reserves.
We originate loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Further, we securitize and trade in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In connection with these activities, we have provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, certain representations and warranties. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached. We have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that we securitized in commercial mortgage-backed securities. For additional information, see also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.
We currently have several legal proceedings related to claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties. If there are decisions adverse to us in those legal proceedings, we may incur losses substantially in excess of our reserves. In addition, our reserves are based, in part, on certain factual and legal assumptions. If those assumptions are incorrect and need to be revised, we may need to adjust our reserves substantially.
Our commodities activities and investments subject us to extensive regulation, and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.
In connection with the commodities activities in our Institutional Securities business segment, we engage in the storage, transportation, marketing and execution of transactions in several commodities, including metals, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, and other commodity products. In

addition, we are an electricity power marketer in the U.S. and own a minority interest in Heidmar Holdings LLC, which owns a group of companies that provide international marine transportation and U.S. marine logistics services. As a result of these activities, we are subject to extensive energy, commodities, environmental, health and safety and other governmental laws and regulations. Further, through these activities we are exposed to regulatory, physical and certain indirect risks associated with climate change.
Although we have attempted to mitigate our environmental risks by, among other measures, selling or ceasing most of our prior petroleum storage and transportation activities, adopting appropriate policies and procedures, and implementing emergency response programs, these actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by these events.
During the past several years, intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and abroad and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement, litigation and remedial proceedings involving companies conducting the activities in which we are engaged. In addition, new regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will impose significant new costs and impose new requirements on our commodities derivatives activities. We may incur substantial costs or loss of revenue in complying with current or future laws and regulations and our overall businesses and reputation may be adversely affected by the current legal environment. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties.

A failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.
As a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals, we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business. For example, potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client, among clients, between an employee on the one hand
and us or a client on the other, or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client. We have policies, procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest. However, identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging, and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny. Indeed, actions that merely appear to create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated. It is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation.
Our regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed examinations of specific transactions. For example, our status as a bank holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve subjects us to direct Federal Reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and their affiliates. Further, the Volcker Rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients.
Risk Management
Our risk management strategies, models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk.
We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, models and processes, including our use of various risk models for assessing market exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. As our businesses change and grow, and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management strategies, models and processes may not always adapt with those changes. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management’s judgment. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and therefore cannot anticipate sudden, unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements, which could cause us to incur losses.

Management of market, credit, liquidity, operational, legal, regulatory and compliance risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. For example, to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions. We may, therefore, incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities. For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies, models and processes, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A.
Competitive Environment
We face strong competition from other financial services firms, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
The financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete with commercial banks, brokerage firms, insurance companies, electronic trading and clearing platforms, financial data repositories, sponsors of mutual funds, hedge funds, energy companies and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the U.S., globally and through the internet. We compete on the basis of several factors, including transaction execution, capital or access to capital, products and services, innovation, technology, reputation, risk appetite and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses, been acquired by or merged into other firms, or have declared bankruptcy. Such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge. We have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. In addition, certain of our competitors may be subject to different, and, in some cases, less stringent, legal and regulatory regimes, than we are, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. For more informa-
tion regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see “Business—Competition” and “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1.
Automated trading markets may adversely affect our business and may increase competition.
We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to execute securities, derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities, and other automated trading platforms has increased the pressure on bid-offer spreads, commissions, markups or comparable fees. The trend toward direct access to automated, electronic markets will likely continue and will likely increase as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms. We have experienced and it is likely that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing bid-offer spreads, commissions, markups or comparable fees.
Our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.
Our people are our most important resource and competition for qualified employees is intense. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or do so at rates or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. The financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation, including limitations relating to incentive-based compensation, clawback requirements and special taxation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees.
International Risk
We are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways.
We are subject to political, economic, legal, tax, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, increased taxes and levies, and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability. In many countries, the

 	LOGO
 
laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.
Various emerging market countries have experienced severe political, economic or financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, high rates of inflation and low or negative growth rates in their economies. Crime and corruption, as well as issues of security and personal safety, also exist in certain of these countries. These conditions could adversely impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial markets generally.
The emergence of a disease pandemic or other widespread health emergency, or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency as well as natural disasters, terrorist activities or military actions, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses around the world.
As a U.S. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, as well as applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. A violation of a sanction, embargo program, or anti-corruption law could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.
The U.K.’s anticipated withdrawal from the E.U. could adversely affect us.
On June 23, 2016, the U.K. electorate voted to leave the E.U. It is difficult to predict the future of the U.K.’s relationship with the E.U., which uncertainty may increase the volatility in the global financial markets in the short- and medium-term. The U.K. Prime Minister has confirmed the U.K. will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by no later than the end of March 2017, subject to the passing of necessary legislation by the U.K. Parliament. This will trigger a two-year period, subject to extension, during which the U.K. government is expected to negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the E.U. Absent any changes to this time schedule, the U.K.
is expected to leave the E.U. in early 2019. The terms and conditions of the anticipated withdrawal from the E.U., and which of the several alternative models of relationship that the U.K. might seek to negotiate with the E.U., remain uncertain. However, the U.K. government has stated that the U.K. will leave the E.U. single market and will seek a phased period of implementation for the new relationship that may cover the legal and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions with significant operations in Europe, such as the Firm. Potential effects of the U.K. exit from the E.U. and potential mitigation actions may vary considerably depending on the timing of withdrawal and the nature of any transition or successor arrangements. Any future limitations on providing financial services into the E.U. from our U.K. operations could require us to make potentially significant changes to our operations in the U.K. and Europe and our legal structure there, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Acquisition, Divestiture and Joint Venture Risk
We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority stakes or strategic alliances.
In connection with past or future acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority stakes or strategic alliances (including with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.), we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining, transferring, separating or integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, trading counterparties and business partners. In the case of joint ventures and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.
In addition, conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our joint venture partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant joint venture.
There is no assurance that any of our acquisitions or divestitures will be successfully integrated or disaggregated or yield all of the positive benefits anticipated. If we are not able to integrate or disaggregate successfully our past and future acquisitions or dispositions, there is a risk that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.
Certain of our business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact, directly or

indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.
For more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we operate, see also “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1.
 
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
We, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receive written comments from the staff of the SEC regarding our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
 
In addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.
The Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Firm’s business, and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. The Firm’s future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm.
In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. The Firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation. Subject to the foregoing, the Firm believes, based on current
knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Firm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the Firm’s operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the Firm’s revenues or income for such period.
Over the last several years, the level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by government and self-regulatory agencies has increased materially in the financial services industry. As a result, the Firm expects that it will continue to be the subject of elevated claims for damages and other relief and, while the Firm has identified below certain proceedings that the Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.

an amended complaint. On January 25, 2017, the court denied the Firm’s demurrer with respect to the amended complaint.
Currency Related Matters
The Firm is responding to a number of regulatory and governmental inquiries both in the United States and abroad related to its foreign exchange business. In addition, on June 29, 2015, the Firm and a number of other financial institutions were named as respondents in a proceeding before Brazil’s Council for Economic Defense related to alleged anticompetitive activity in the foreign exchange market for the Brazilian Real.
The Firm, as well as other foreign exchange dealers, are defendants in In Re Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litigation, pending in the SDNY. On July 16, 2015, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint generally alleging that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix, maintain or make artificial prices for key benchmark rates, to manipulate bid/ask spreads, and, by their behavior in the over-the-counter market, to thereby cause corresponding manipulation in the foreign exchange futures market. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. On December 16, 2016, the Firm and plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation with respect to the Firm. After it is finalized by the parties, the settlement will be subject to court approval.
European Matters
On June 26, 2006, the public prosecutor in Parma, Italy brought criminal charges against certain present and former employees of the Firm related to the bankruptcy of Parmalat in 2003. The trial commenced in September 2009 and the evidence phase concluded in January 2017. A verdict is expected during the course of 2017. While the Firm is not a defendant in the criminal proceeding, certain investors have asserted civil claims against the Firm related to the proceedings. These claims seek, among other relief, moral damages and loss of opportunity damages related to their purchase of approximately €327 million in bonds issued by Parmalat. In addition, on October 11, 2011, an Italian financial institution, Banco Popolare Societá Cooperativa (“Banco Popolare”), filed a civil claim against the Firm in the Milan courts, styled Banco Popolare Societá Cooperativa v Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc & others (File number 63671/2011), related to its purchase of €100 million of bonds issued by Parmalat. The claim asserted by Banco Popolare alleges, among other things, that the Firm was aware of Parmalat’s impending insolvency and conspired with others to deceive Banco Popolare into buying bonds by concealing both Parmalat’s true financial condition and certain features
of the bonds from the market and Banco Popolare. Banco Popolare seeks damages of €76 million (approximately $80 million) plus damages for loss of opportunity and moral damages. The Firm filed its answer on April 20, 2012, and the hearing on the parties’ final submissions is scheduled for March 20, 2018.
On May 12, 2016, the Austrian state of Land Salzburg filed a claim against the Firm in the Regional Court in Frankfurt, Germany, styled Land Salzburg v. Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the “German Proceedings”) seeking €209 million (approximately $220 million) plus interest, attorneys’ fees and other relief relating to certain fixed income and commodities derivative transactions which Land Salzburg entered into with the Firm between 2005 and 2012. Land Salzburg has alleged that it had neither the capacity nor authority to enter into such transactions, which should be set aside, and that the Firm breached certain advisory and other duties which the Firm had owed to it. On April 28, 2016, the Firm filed an action against Land Salzburg in the High Court in London, England styled Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc v. Land Salzburg (the “English Proceedings”) in which the Firm is seeking declarations that Land Salzburg had both the capacity and authority to enter into the transactions, and that the Firm has no liability to Land Salzburg arising from them. On July 25, 2016, the Firm filed an application with the Regional Court in Frankfurt to stay the German Proceedings on the basis that the High Court in London was first seized of the dispute between the parties and, pending determination of that application, filed its statement of defense on December 23, 2016. On December 8, 2016, Land Salzburg filed an application with the High Court in London challenging its jurisdiction to determine the English Proceedings.
On July 11, 2016, the Firm received an invitation to respond to a proposed claim (“Proposed Claim”) by the public prosecutor for Court of Accounts for the Republic of Italy. The Proposed Claim relates to certain derivative transactions between the Republic of Italy and the Firm. The transactions were originally entered into between 1999 and 2005, and were terminated in December 2011 and January 2012. The Proposed Claim alleges, inter alia, that the Firm was acting as an agent of the Republic of Italy, that some or all of the derivative transactions were improper and that the termination of the transactions was also improper. The Proposed Claim indicates that, if a proceeding is initiated against the Firm, the public prosecutor would be asserting administrative claims against the Firm for €2.879 billion (approximately $3 billion). The Firm does not agree with the Proposed Claim and presented its defenses to the public prosecutor.

Bank of America Corporation et al. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on February 2, 2015 asserting claims for alleged violations of the Sherman Act, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and tortious interference with contract. The consolidated amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants engaged in antitrust violations with regards to the process of setting ISDAfix, a financial benchmark and seeks treble damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and other relief. On March 28, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

The total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by the Firm was approximately $233 million. The complaint raises claims under the Washington State Securities Act and seeks, among other

The amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by the Firm was approximately $276 million. The complaint raises claims under both the federal securities laws and California law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff’s purchase of such certificates.

Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of our outstanding stock under a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”).

The Share Repurchase Program has no set expiration or termination date. Share repurchases are subject to regulatory approval. In June 2016, we received a conditional non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 capital plan, which included a share repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of our outstanding common stock during the period beginning July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our Share Repurchase Program.

Consolidated Results: 2016 Compared with 2015
 
•	 	
We reported net revenues of $34,631 million in 2016, compared with $35,155 million in 2015. For 2016, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, compared with $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2015.
 
•	 	
Results for 2016 included net discrete tax benefits of $68 million or $0.04 per diluted common share, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Results for 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues due to the impact of debt valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $618 million or $0.20 per diluted common share. For a further discussion of the net discrete tax bene-

fits, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income Tax Matters” herein.
 
•	 	
Effective January 1, 2016, we early adopted a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities that requires unrealized gains and losses from debt-related credit spreads and other credit factors (i.e., DVA) to be presented in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) as opposed to Trading revenues. Results for 2015 and 2014 are not restated pursuant to that guidance.
 
•	 	
Net revenues were $34,631 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared with net revenues of $34,537 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,728 million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, excluding DVA in 2015. Excluding the net discrete tax benefits, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefits in 2015. (see “Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information” herein).
Consolidated Results: 2015 Compared with 2014
 
•	 	
We reported net revenues of $35,155 million in 2015, compared with $34,275 million in 2014. In 2015, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $3,467 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share in 2014.
 
•	 	
Results for 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues due to the impact of DVA of $618 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 included net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, due to the release of a deferred tax liability associated with a legal entity restructuring, remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax examination, and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income Tax Matters” herein. Results for 2014 also included positive revenues associated with DVA of $651 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 also included litigation costs related to residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis matters of $3,083 million, or a loss of $1.47 per diluted common share, 2014 compensation actions of approxi-
 	 	
mately $1,137 million (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein), or a loss of $0.39 per diluted common share, and a funding valuation adjustment (“FVA”) implementation charge of $468 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted common share.
 
•	 	
Excluding DVA, net revenues were $34,537 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,728 million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with net revenues of $33,624 million, and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $3,049 million, or $1.39 per diluted common share, in 2014. Excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefits, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $823 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, in 2014 (see “Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information” herein). For a further discussion of the net discrete tax benefits, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income Tax Matters” herein.
Business Segment Net Revenues: 2016 Compared with 2015
 
•	 	
Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,459 million in 2016 decreased 3% compared with $17,953 million in 2015, primarily as a result of lower Investment banking and sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher Other revenues.
 
•	 	
Wealth Management net revenues of $15,350 million in 2016 increased 2% from $15,100 million in 2015, primarily as a result of growth in Net interest income, partially offset by lower Commissions and fees and Investment banking revenues.
 
•	 	
Investment Management net revenues of $2,112 million in 2016 decreased 9% from $2,315 million in 2015, primarily reflecting weaker investment performance compared with 2015. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not re-occur in 2016. Asset management fees in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015.
Business Segment Net Revenues: 2015 Compared with 2014
 
•	 	
Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,953 million in 2015 increased 6% compared with $16,871 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher sales and trading net revenues, partially offset by lower Other revenues and lower revenues in Investment banking.
 
•	 	
Wealth Management net revenues of $15,100 million in 2015 increased 1% from $14,888 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher Net interest income and asset management revenues, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.

Table of Contents

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
•	 	
Investment Management net revenues of $2,315 million in 2015 decreased 15% from $2,712 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to non-controlling interests and markdowns on principal investments.
Consolidated Non-Interest Expenses: 2016 Compared with 2015
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses of $15,878 million in 2016 decreased 1% from $16,016 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses were $9,905 million in 2016 compared with $10,644 million in 2015, representing a 7% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs and expense management.
Consolidated Non-Interest Expenses: 2015 Compared with 2014
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses of $16,016 million in 2015 decreased 10% from $17,824 million in 2014, primarily as a result of the 2014 compensation actions, and a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, related carried interest, and the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses were $10,644 million in 2015 compared with $12,860 million in 2014, representing a 17% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs in the Institutional Securities business segment associated with residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters.
Return on Average Common Equity
 
•	 	
For 2016, the return on average common equity and the return on average common equity, excluding DVA was 8.0%, or 7.9% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. For 2015, the return on average common equity was 8.5%, or 7.8% excluding DVA, and 7.0% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. For 2014, the return on average common equity was 4.8%, or 4.1% excluding DVA, and 0.8% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. See “Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information” herein.
 
Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information
We prepare our consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). From time to time, we may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in this document, or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. A “non-GAAP financial measure” excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us are provided as additional information to investors and analysts in order to provide them with further transparency about, or as an alternative method for assessing, our financial condition, operating results or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.
The principal Non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth below.

DVA represents the change in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in our credit spreads and other credit factors related to liabilities carried at fair value under the fair value option, primarily certain Long-term and Short-term borrowings.
1.	
Pre-tax profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance and represents income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.
2.	
Average common equity and return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures we consider to be useful measures to us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance. Average common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Attribution of Average Common Equity according to the Required Capital Framework” herein). Each business segment’s return on average common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less an allocation of preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity for that segment. Consolidated return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity.
3.	
In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. For 2015 and 2014, DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Net revenues, excluding DVA, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, excluding DVA, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley, excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits, earnings per diluted common share, excluding DVA, earnings per diluted common share, excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits and effective income tax rate from continuing operations, excluding net discrete tax benefits, are non-GAAP financial measures we consider to be useful measures to us, investors and analysts to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance.

The Average common equity, return on average common equity, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share measures set forth in this table are all non-GAAP financial measures we consider to be useful measures to us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance. For a discussion of tangible common equity, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Tangible Equity” herein.

Return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculations of the return on average common equity excluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average common equity measures, where DVA is excluded, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted to exclude the impact of DVA. When excluding the net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator are adjusted to exclude that item in all periods.
3.	
The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(183) million, $(637) million and $(1,108) million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of the net discrete tax benefits on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(40) million, $434 million and $713 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Return on Equity Target
We are aiming to improve our return to shareholders and, accordingly, have established a target return on average common equity (“Return on Equity Target”) of 9% to 11%, excluding DVA to be achieved by 2017, subject to the successful execution of our strategic objectives. We plan to progress toward achieving our Return on Equity Target through the following key elements of our strategy:
 
•	 	
Revenue and profitability growth:
 
 	•	 	
Wealth Management pre-tax margin improvement to approximately 23% to 25% through net interest income growth via continued high-quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;
 
 	•	 	
Continued strength in Investment Banking and Equity Sales and Trading results;
 
 	•	 	
Stable performance in Fixed Income Sales and Trading and Investment Management;
 
•	 	
Expense efficiency:
 
 	•	 	
Successful completion of Project Streamline, our expense savings program launched in 2016 to reduce expenses by $1 billion by 2017 (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties) assuming a flat revenue environment, resulting in an expense efficiency target ratio of 74%;
 
•	 	
Sufficient capital:
 
 	•	 	
Increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.
Our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses and the ability to reduce expenses in general; capital levels; and discrete tax items. Given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals may not be realized. Actual results may differ from our goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. Accordingly, we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.
Return on average common equity and pre-tax margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance. See “Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Information” herein. Our expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. For 2016, our expense efficiency ratio was 74.5%, which was calculated as non-interest expenses of $25,783 million divided by net revenues of $34,631 million.
Business Segments
Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.
Net Revenues
Investment Banking.    Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.
Trading.    Trading revenues include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of financial instruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.
As a market maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:
 
(i)	
taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell and—depending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the position—to hold those positions for a period of time;
 
(ii)	
managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;
 
(iii)	
building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand;
 
(iv)	
trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and
 
(v)	
engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.
Although not included in Trading revenues, Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.
We often invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either Trading revenues or Investments revenues. Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. Generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes in fair value of the investments made by us.
Investments.    Our investments generally are held for long-term appreciation, or as discussed above, for hedging purposes and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products.
The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.
Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in certain Investment Management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time where we are clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.
Commissions and Fees.    Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any related services are recorded in Commissions and fees.
Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees.    Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.
Asset management, distribution and administration fees in the Wealth Management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for Investment Management. Mutual fund distribution fees in the Wealth Management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.
Asset management fees in the Investment Management business segment arise from investment management services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. We receive fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. Performance-based fees in the Investment Management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.

Net Interest.    Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities; Investment securities, which include available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities; Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; Loans; Deposits; Other short-term borrowings; Long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokerage business; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.
Other.    Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on AFS securities, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.
Net Revenues by Segment
Institutional Securities.    Net revenues are composed of Investment banking revenues, Sales and trading net revenues, Investments and Other revenues.
For information about the composition of Investment banking revenues, see “Net Revenues” herein. 
Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues; Commissions and fees; Asset management, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest. In assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to trading are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.
Sales and trading revenues are broken down into major business lines as follows: equity, fixed income and other. See “Sales and Trading Activities—Equity and Fixed Income” for a description of the activities within equity and fixed income. Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) on economic hedges related to long-term borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending activities.
For information about revenue from Investments, see “Net Revenues” herein.
Other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.
Wealth Management.    Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues.
Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. Trading revenues include revenues from customers’ purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
Asset management revenues include Asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.
Net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on AFS securities and HTM securities, interest on lending activities and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions, and bank deposit program activity.
Other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on AFS securities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
Investment Management.    Investments revenue is primarily earned on investments in certain closed-end funds that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.
For information about the composition of Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees, see “Net Revenues” herein. 
Compensation Expense
Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. The factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid
 
 
 	39	 	December 2016 Form 10-K
Table of Contents

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm, business unit and individual performance. Compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits, etc.).
Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

Source: Thomson Reuters, data at January 17, 2017. Completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related offerings and fixed income offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or change in the value of a transaction.

Amounts include transactions of $100 million or more.
3.	
Amounts include Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock and convertible securities and rights offerings.
4.	
Amounts include non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and taxable municipal debt. Amounts include publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. Amounts exclude leveraged loans and self-led issuances.
2016 Compared with 2015
Investment banking revenues of $4,476 million in 2016 decreased 11% from 2015 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by an increase in advisory revenues in 2016.
 
•	 	
Advisory revenues increased reflecting the higher dollar volume of completed merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions (“M&A”) activity (see Investment Banking Volumes table). As the number of completed transactions decreased in 2016 versus 2015, the 2016 revenue increase was at a lower rate than the percentage increase in dollar volume.
 
•	 	
Equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of lower equity-related offerings in 2016 (see Investment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower bond and loan fees.
2015 Compared with 2014
Investment banking revenues of $5,008 million in 2015 decreased 4% from 2014 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by higher advisory revenues.
 
•	 	
Advisory revenues increased led primarily by M&A fee realization in the Americas.
 
•	 	
Equity underwriting revenues decreased on reduced volumes driven by lower initial public offerings (see Investment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower non-investment grade bond and loan fees.

In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. In 2015 and 2014, DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Represents the initial implementation of FVA.
3.	
Effective in 2016, the Institutional Securities “Fixed Income and Commodities” business has been renamed the “Fixed Income” business.
Sales and trading net revenues, including equity and fixed income sales and trading net revenues that exclude the impact of DVA in 2015, or exclude the impact of DVA and the initial implementation of FVA in 2014, are non-GAAP financial measures that we consider useful for us, investors and analysts to allow further comparability of period-to-period operating performance.
Sales and Trading Activities—Equity and Fixed Income
Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equities and fixed income businesses as well as
how their results impact the income statement line items, followed by a presentation and explanation of results.
Equities—Financing.    We provide financing and prime brokerage services to our clients active in the equity markets through a variety of products including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Net interest for securities and equity lending products and in Trading revenues for derivative products.
Equities—Execution services.    We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges as well as from OTC transactions. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory, which are reflected in Trading revenues.
Fixed income—Within fixed income we make markets in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products and services.
 
•	 	
Global macro products.    We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreign exchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities, loans and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to stand ready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues.
 
•	 	
Credit products.    We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The value of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected in Trading revenues. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.
 
•	 	
Commodities products.    We make markets in various commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil, and precious metals, with the results primarily reflected in Trading revenues.

In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. In 2015 and 2014, the DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.
As discussed in “Net Revenues by Segment” herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate net revenues, which are comprised of the consolidated income statement line items quantified in the previous table. Trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes, bid-offer spreads, and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. We provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period
over period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.
For additional information on total Trading revenues, see the table “Trading Revenues by Product Type” in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
2016 Compared with 2015
Equity
Excluding the $163 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,037 million in 2016 were lower than 2015, reflecting lower results in both financing and execution services revenues.
 
•	 	
Financing revenues were in line with the results from 2015 as Net interest revenues declined from higher net interest costs, reflecting the business’ increased portion of global liquidity reserve requirements, offset by increased client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading.
 
•	 	
Execution services decreased 2% from 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in fee revenues of $196 million due to reduced client activity.
Fixed Income
Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, fixed income net revenues of $5,117 million in 2016 were 19% higher than 2015, primarily due to improved results in credit products.
 
•	 	
Credit products Trading revenues were the primary driver for the overall increase in fixed income Trading revenues of $782 million, reflecting an improved credit market environment that resulted in gains on inventory in 2016 compared with losses in 2015.
 
•	 	
Overall results from other fixed income businesses were relatively unchanged. There was a net increase in Trading revenues from global macro products, reflecting gains on inventory in interest rate products, offset by declines in commodities activities, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. For more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see “Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items—2015 Compared with 2014—Dispositions” herein.
Other
 
•	 	
Other sales and trading net losses of $853 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting losses in 2016 associated with corporate loan hedging activity.

2015 Compared with 2014
Equity
Equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased reflecting higher results in financing and execution services revenues.
 
•	 	
Financing revenues increased 19% from 2014 with an increase in client balances and derivative activity reflected in the $457 million increase in Trading revenues primarily from equity swaps and a $103 million increase in Net interest revenues for securities.
 
•	 	
Execution services increased 17% from 2014, primarily due to the $587 million increase in Trading revenues from client activity in derivatives and reduced inventory losses compared with the prior year.
Fixed Income
Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, and the $419 million positive impact of DVA and the $466 million negative impact from the implementation of FVA on 2014 results, fixed income net revenues of $4,303 million in 2015 were 1% higher than 2014 due to improved results in global macro and commodities products, offset by lower results in credit products.
 
•	 	
Global macro products results increased from 2014, primarily due to an increase in Trading revenues due to improved results in interest rate products as a result of inventory gains and improved performance in foreign exchange products
 
•	 	
Credit products decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in Trading revenues from lower results in credit and securitized products from a widening credit spread environment, which led to inventory losses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Net interest revenues, driven primarily by a change in the product mix in the securitized products group assets.
 
•	 	
Commodities products net revenues increased, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. The increase was partially offset by credit-driven losses and the absence of revenues from TransMontaigne Inc., which was sold on July 1, 2014 (see “Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items—2015 Compared with 2014—Dispositions” herein).
Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items
2016 Compared with 2015
Investments
 
•	 	
Net investment gains of $147 million in 2016 decreased from 2015 as a result of lower gains on real estate and business-related investments and losses on investments associated with our compensation plans compared with gains in 2015.
Other
 
•	 	
Other revenues of $535 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale in 2016 compared with mark-to-market losses in 2015, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (“MUMSS”) (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).
Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $12,336 million in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily reflecting a 3% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 11% reduction in Non-compensation expenses in 2016.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower litigation costs and Professional services expense. In 2015, Non-compensation expenses included increases to reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap (“CDS”) antitrust litigation matter and legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters.
2015 Compared with 2014
Investments
 
•	 	
Net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from 2014 driven by gains on business-related investments.
Other
 
•	 	
Other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from 2014 due to the absence of gains realized on certain assets sold in 2014 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment.

Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from 2014 driven by a 25% reduction in Non-compensation expenses and a 17% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses decreased, primarily due to lower litigation costs.
Income Tax Items
In 2016, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.
In 2015, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).
In 2014, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $839 million. This included net discrete tax benefits of $612 million principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. In addition, our Provision for (benefit from) income taxes was impacted by approximately $900 million of tax provision as a result of non-deductible expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters.
Dispositions
On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton Commodities International LLC. The loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in Other revenues.
On July 1, 2014, we completed the sale of our ownership stake in TransMontaigne Inc., a U.S.-based oil storage, marketing and transportation company, as well as related physical inventory and the assumption of our obligations under certain terminal storage contracts, to NGL Energy Partners LP. The gain on sale of $112 million was recognized in Other revenues.
On March 27, 2014, we completed the sale of Canterm Canadian Terminals Inc., a public storage terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in Canada. The gain on sale was approximately $45 million and was recognized in Other revenues.
Other Items
Japanese Securities Joint Venture
We hold a 40% voting interest and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (“MUFG”) holds a 60% voting interest in MUMSS.
To the extent that losses incurred by MUMSS result in a requirement to restore its capital level, MUFG is solely responsible for providing this additional capital to a minimum level, whereas we are not obligated to contribute additional capital to MUMSS. To the extent that MUMSS is required to increase its capital level due to factors other than losses, such as changes in regulatory requirements, both MUFG and we are required to contribute the necessary capital based upon the economic interest as set forth above.
See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.
Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests primarily relate to MUFG’s interest in Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd.

Effective July 1, 2016, the Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments entered into an agreement, whereby Institutional Securities assumed management of Wealth Management’s fixed income client-driven trading activities and employees. Institutional Securities now pays fees to Wealth Management based on distribution activity (collectively, the “Fixed Income Integration”). Prior periods have not been recast for this new intersegment agreement due to immateriality.

2016 Compared with 2015
Net Revenues
Transactional Revenues
Transactional revenues of $3,090 million in 2016 decreased 7% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower revenues related to commissions and fees and investment banking revenues, partially offset by higher trading revenues.
 
•	 	
Investment banking revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of unit investment trusts, equity and structured products.
 
•	 	
Trading revenues increased in 2016, primarily due to gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses in 2015.
 
•	 	
Commissions and fees decreased in 2016 reflecting lower daily average commissions, primarily due to reduced client activity in equity, annuity and mutual fund products. This decrease was partially offset by increased fees due to the Fixed Income Integration.
Asset Management
Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,454 million in 2016 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund fees. Revenues from fee-based accounts were relatively flat with decreased client fee rates, partially offset by positive flows. See “Fee-Based Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type” herein for more details.
Net Interest
Net interest of $3,529 million in 2016 increased 19% from the prior year, primarily due to higher loan balances and investment portfolio yields.
Other
Other revenues of $277 million in 2016 increased 9% from the prior year due to the combination of higher referral fees in 2016 and a decrease in provision for loan losses in 2016.
Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $11,913 million in 2016 increased 1% from the prior year.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses increased in 2016, primarily as a result of a $70 million provision related to certain brokerage service reporting activities. See “Other Items” herein.
2015 Compared with 2014
Net Revenues
Transactional Revenues
Transactional revenues of $3,335 million in 2015 decreased 14% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of Trading, Investment banking, and Commissions and fees.
 
•	 	
Investment banking revenues decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of underwritten offerings.
 
•	 	
Trading revenues decreased, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.
 
•	 	
Commissions and fees decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from equity, mutual fund and annuity products, partially offset by higher revenues from alternative asset classes.
Asset Management
Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,536 million in 2015 increased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to higher fee-based revenues that resulted from positive flows and higher average market values over 2015 as compared with the average market values during 2014. The increase in fee-based revenues was partially offset by lower referral fees from the bank deposit program, reflecting the completion of the transfer of deposits from Citigroup Inc. (“Citi”) to us in connection with the former retail securities joint venture between the Firm and Citi. See “Fee-Based Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type” herein for more details.
Net Interest
Net interest of $2,956 million in 2015 increased 26% from the prior year, primarily due to higher balances in the bank deposit program and growth in loans and lending commitments.
Other
Other revenues of $255 million in 2015 decreased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to a $40 million gain on sale of a retail property space in the prior year and an increase in the provision for loan losses in 2015.

Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $11,768 million in 2015 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in Professional services, resulting from increased consulting and legal fees, partially offset by a provision related to a rescission offer in the prior year. Other expenses in 2014 included $50 million related to a rescission offer to Wealth Management clients who may not have received a prospectus for certain securities transactions, for which delivery of a prospectus was required.
Income Tax Items
In 2014, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $1,390 million due
to the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Income Tax Matters” herein.
Other Items
The Firm has identified operational issues that resulted in the reporting of incorrect cost basis tax information to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and retail brokerage clients for tax years 2011 through 2016. Most of our clients are not impacted by these issues. However, these issues have affected a significant number of client accounts. In the case of clients for whom the Firm has determined that there have been tax underpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm is in advanced discussions with the IRS to resolve client tax underpayments to the IRS caused by these issues at no expense to our clients. In the case of clients for whom the Firm has determined that there have been tax overpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm plans to notify them and to offer to pay them an amount equivalent to their overpayment to the IRS. The $70 million provision referred to above is based on currently available information and analyses, and our review of these issues is continuing.
 
 
Fee-Based Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type
Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of fee-based client assets related to certain account types that we offer. These fees, which we record in the Asset management, distribution and administration fees line on its income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client participates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. Across the account types, fees will vary based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.

2016 Compared with 2015
Net Revenues
Investments
 
•	 	
Investments gains of $13 million in 2016 decreased 95% from the prior year reflecting weaker investment performance compared with the prior year. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not re-occur in 2016.
Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees
 
•	 	
Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,063 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, as increases in management fees resulting from higher assets under management or supervision (“AUM”) and average fee rates in certain products were offset by lower performance fees (see “AUM and Average Fee Rate by Asset Class” herein).
Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $1,825 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, primarily due to higher
Non-compensation expenses offset by lower Compensation and benefits expenses.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in salaries.
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees, partially offset by lower litigation costs and expense management.
2015 Compared with 2014
Net Revenues
Investments
 
•	 	
Investments gains of $249 million in 2015 decreased 58% from the prior year reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest associated with Asia private equity and additional net markdowns on principal investments.
Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees
 
•	 	
Asset management, distribution and administration fees were unchanged from the prior year as the impact of positive net flows was offset by a shift in the asset class mix from equity and fixed income products to liquidity products (see “AUM and Average Fee Rate by Asset Class” herein).
Other
 
•	 	
Other revenues of $32 million in 2015 decreased 70% from the prior year due to lower revenues associated with our minority investment in certain third-party investment managers.
Non-interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $1,823 million in 2015 decreased 11% from the prior year, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses.
 
•	 	
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in deferred compensation associated with carried interest and a decrease in the level of incentive compensation in 2015 (see also “Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures—Discretionary Incentive Compensation” herein).
 
•	 	
Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees, and professional services resulting from higher consulting and legal fees and information processing and communications expenses.

Supplemental Financial Information and Disclosures
Legal
We incurred legal expenses of $263 million in 2016, $563 million in 2015 and $3,364 million in 2014. Legal expenses are included in Other expenses in the consolidated income statements.
Legal expenses incurred in 2015 were primarily related to increases in reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap antitrust litigation matter and for legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. The legal expenses incurred in 2014 were principally due to reserve additions and settlements related to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis related matters, including our $2,600 million agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, which was reached on February 25, 2015 and finalized on February 10, 2016 (see “Contingencies—Legal” in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
We provide loans to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals, primarily through our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”). The lending activities in the Institutional Securities business segment primarily include loans or lending commitments to corporate clients. The lending activities in the Wealth Management business segment primarily include securities-based lending that allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities and also include residential real estate loans. We expect our lending activities to continue to grow through further market penetration of the Wealth Management business segment’s client base. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk” in Item 7A. For further discussion about loans and lending commitments, see Notes 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

2016
Included in the effective tax rate for 2016 were net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 would have been 31.6%, which is generally reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.
2015
Included in the effective tax rate for 2015 were net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the U.K. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%.
2014
Included in the effective tax rate for 2014 were net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. These net discrete tax benefits consisted of: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of Smith Barney in 2009 through a charge to Additional paid-in capital, as a result of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%, which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from non-deductible expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.
Discretionary Incentive Compensation
On December 1, 2014, the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee (“CMDS Committee”) of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an approach for awards of discretionary incentive compensation for the 2014 performance year that were granted in 2015, which reduced the average deferral of such awards to an approximate baseline of 50%. Additionally, the CMDS Committee approved the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards. The deferred cash-based incentive compensation
awards subject to accelerated vesting will be distributed on their regularly scheduled future distribution dates and will continue to be subject to cancellation and clawback provisions. The following table presents the increase in Compensation and benefits expense for the Firm and each of the business segments as a result of these actions in 2014 (“2014 compensation actions”).

Accounting Development Updates
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following accounting updates that apply to us.
We consider the applicability and impact of all accounting updates. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The following accounting update was adopted on January 1, 2017.
 
•	 	
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    This accounting update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the recognition of forfeitures, the classification of income tax consequences, and the classification within the cash flow statements. This guidance became effective for us as of January 1, 2017, and the transition impact was not significant. With this update, the income tax consequences for these payments are required to be recognized in Provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements instead of additional paid-in capital. The impact of the income tax consequences may be either a benefit or a provision, and will primarily occur in the first quarter of each year as share-based awards to employees are

converted to Morgan Stanley shares. The impact of recognizing excess tax benefits upon conversion of awards in January 2017 was an approximate $110 million benefit to the Provision for income taxes.
The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:
 
•	 	
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    This accounting update aims to clarify the principles of revenue recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating the method of adoption.
We expect this accounting update to potentially change the timing and presentation of certain revenues, as well as the timing and presentation of certain related costs, for Investment banking fees and Asset management, distribution and administration fees. Outside of Investment Management performance fees in the form of carried interest, discussed further in the following paragraph, these changes are not expected to be significant.
Regarding the recognition of performance fees from fund management activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal, there are alternative views in the industry which include consideration as to whether these arrangements are in the scope of the new revenue guidance or are financial instruments under the scope of equity method of accounting. If we follow the equity method of accounting principles, the current recognition of such fees would remain essentially unchanged. If the fees are deemed in the scope of the new revenue guidance, we would defer recognition until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which would cause a significant delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue. We are currently assessing the alternative accounting approaches and continue to closely monitor developments in this still-evolving area.
We will continue to assess the impact of the new rule as we progress through the implementation of the new standard; therefore, additional impacts may be identified prior to adoption.
 
•	 	
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses.    This accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and HTM securities. The amendments in this
 	 	
update will accelerate the recognition of credit losses by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology that requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset. Additionally, although the CECL methodology will not apply to AFS debt securities, the update will require establishment of an allowance to reflect impairment of these securities, thereby eliminating the concept of a permanent write-down. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020.
 
•	 	
Leases.    This accounting update requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. The right of use asset and lease liability will initially be measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019.
 
•	 	
Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.    This accounting update clarifies the guidance on how to account for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets and also provides guidance on the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. This update is effective as of January 1, 2018.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
Fair Value
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value
A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:
 
•	 	
Trading assets and Trading liabilities;
 
•	 	
Investment Securities—AFS securities;
 
•	 	
Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;
 
•	 	
Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;

•	 	
Certain Short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes;
 
•	 	
Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;
 
•	 	
Certain Other secured financings; and
 
•	 	
Certain Long-term borrowings, primarily structured notes.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. For further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, certain of our assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.
For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Fair Value Control Processes
We employ control processes designed to validate the fair value of our financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our valuation policies, processes and procedures.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value,
 
 
 	55	 	December 2016 Form 10-K
Table of Contents

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment.
The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.
For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.
See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.
Legal and Regulatory Contingencies
In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.
Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.
We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by
governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.
For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
Significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.
See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.
Income Taxes
We are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various
 
 
December 2016 Form 10-K	 	56

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.
Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Our deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s
estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that we estimate it is more likely than not to realize at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.
Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our tax examinations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury Department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our consolidated balance sheets, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Board’s Risk Committee.
The Balance Sheet
We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.
We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Total assets increased to $815 billion at December 31, 2016 from $787 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in Trading assets within Institutional Securities, including increases in highly liquid U.S. government and agency securities and corporate equities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in Securities borrowed driven by a decrease in Trading liabilities. Cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from bank deposits continued to be redeployed into Investment securities and lending activity primarily within the Wealth Management business segment.
Securities Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending
Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

At December 31, 2016, differences between period end balances and average balances during the three months ended December 31, 2016 in the previous table were not significant. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned at December 31, 2015 were lower than the average balances during 2015. The balances moved in line with client financing activity and with general movements in Trading assets and liabilities. Additionally, included within securities financing transactions were $14 billion and $11 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to fully collateralized securities-for-securities lending transactions represented in Trading assets.
Customer Securities Financing
The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.
Liquidity Risk Management Framework
The primary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies.
The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:
 
•	 	
Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;
 
•	 	
Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;
 
•	 	
Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and
•	 	
Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.
The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and the Global Liquidity Reserve (as defined below), which support our target liquidity profile.
Required Liquidity Framework
Our Required Liquidity Framework reflects the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.
Liquidity Stress Tests
We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. These scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the Required Liquidity Framework.
The scenarios or assumptions used by us in our Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
•	 	
No government support;
 
•	 	
No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;
 
•	 	
Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;
 
•	 	
Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;
 
•	 	
Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;
 
•	 	
Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;
 
•	 	
Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;
 
•	 	
Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties;

•	 	
Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions;
 
•	 	
Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; and
 
•	 	
Maturity roll-off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance.
Liquidity Stress Tests are produced for the Parent Company and major operating subsidiaries, as well as at major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries’ liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinning the Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.
At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Global Liquidity Reserve
We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the Global Liquidity Reserve is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. In addition, our Global Liquidity Reserve includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change dependent on market and Firm-specific events. The Global Liquidity Reserve is held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries.

Regulatory Liquidity Framework
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (“Basel Committee”) Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) standard is designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. The standard’s objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.
We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements issued by U.S. banking regulators (“U.S. LCR”), which are based on the Basel Committee’s LCR, including a requirement to calculate each entity’s U.S. LCR on each business day. As of January 1, 2017, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum of 100% of the fully phased-in U.S. LCR. In addition, effective April 1, 2017, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our U.S. LCR calculation after each calendar quarter. We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required U.S. LCR based on current interpretations.
Net Stable Funding Ratio
The objective of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
The Basel Committee finalized the NSFR framework in 2014. In May 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debt liabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.
If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries beginning January 1, 2018. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures following the closing of the public comment period. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary to meet the requirement, which we expect to accomplish by the effective date of the final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Funding Management
We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.
We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include our equity capital, long-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”), securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.
Secured Financing
A substantial portion of our total assets consist of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the Institutional Securities business. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage the secured financing book based on the quality of the assets being funded.
We utilize shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and have established longer tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days. To further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the Liquidity Risk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Global Liquidity Reserve against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.
We also maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. With the implementation of liquidity standards, we have also incorporated high-quality liquid asset classifications that are consistent with the U.S. LCR definitions into our encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics of the unencumbered asset pool and our ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.
Unsecured Financing
We view long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding. Unencumbered securities and non-security assets are financed with a combination of long-term and short-term debt and deposits. Our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on the performance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. When appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
Deposits
Available funding sources to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries include demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, time deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are
 
 
 	61	 	December 2016 Form 10-K

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
sourced from our retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, deposits were $155,863 million and $156,034 million, respectively (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
Short-Term Borrowings
Our unsecured short-term borrowings may primarily consist of structured notes, bank loans and bank notes with original maturities of 12 months or less. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $941 million and $2,173 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings.
Long-Term Borrowings
We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of long-term borrowings allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. Availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.
We may engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that we believe are in our investors’ best interests.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016 and through February 21, 2017, long-term borrowings increased by approximately $7.1 billion, net of maturities. This amount includes the issuances of senior debt; $7.0 billion on January 20, 2017 and $3.0 billion on February 17, 2017.
Trust Preferred Securities
During 2016, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust III, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IV, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust V and Morgan Stanley Capital Trust VIII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding Capital Securities pursuant to the
optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. In the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. We concurrently redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.
For further information on long-term borrowings, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Credit Ratings
We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. Rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.
Our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of the U.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position.
The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”). The following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of Moody’s or S&P ratings, based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Capital Management
We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses. We attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries’ required equity.
Common Stock
We repurchased approximately $3,500 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during 2016 and $2,125 million during 2015 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Pursuant to the share repurchase program, we consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under our program will be exercised from time to time at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our capital position and market conditions. The share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by us are subject to regulatory approval (see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5).
The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. On January 17, 2017, we announced that the Board declared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.20. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2017 to common shareholders of record on January 31, 2017.
Preferred Stock
On December 15, 2016, we announced that the Board declared quarterly dividends for preferred stock shareholders of record on December 30, 2016 that were paid on January 17, 2017.
Series K Preferred Stock. In January 2017, we issued 40,000,000 Depositary Shares, for an aggregate price of $1,000 million. Each Depositary Share represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series K, $0.01 par value (“Series K Preferred Stock”). The Series K Preferred Stock is redeemable at our option, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2027 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as described in the terms of that series), in each case at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series K Preferred Stock also has a preference over our common stock upon liquidation. The Series K Preferred Stock offering (net of related issuance costs) resulted in proceeds of approximately $969 million.

Regulatory Requirements
Regulatory Capital Framework
We are a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).
The Basel Committee has recently published revisions to certain standards in its capital framework, including with respect to counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, market risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and securitization capital standards, although these revisions have not yet been adopted by the U.S. banking agencies. In addition, the Basel Committee is actively considering other potential revisions to other capital standards that would substantially change the framework. The impact on us of any revisions to the Basel Committee’s capital standards could be substantial but is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. banking agencies.

Regulatory Capital Requirements
We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) and transition provisions follows.
Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital. Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. Certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.
In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, we will be subject to:
 
•	 	
A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
 
•	 	
The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank (“G-SIB”) capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
 
•	 	
Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer (“CCyB”), currently set by banking regulators at zero (collectively, the “buffers”).
In 2017, the phase-in amount for each of the buffers is 50% of the fully phased-in buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to
executive officers. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see “G-SIB Capital Surcharge” herein.
Risk-Weighted Assets. RWAs reflect both our on- and off-balance sheet risk as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
 
•	 	
Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;
 
•	 	
Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
 
•	 	
Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
For a further discussion of our market, credit and operational risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A.
Our binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWAs (the “Standardized Approach”) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”). At December 31, 2016, our binding ratios are based on the Advanced Approach transitional rules.
The methods for calculating each of our risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as aspects of the capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to our capital base, asset composition, off-balance sheet exposures or risk profile.

Adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under U.S. GAAP during the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 adjusted for disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.
2.	
The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement is 4.0%.
The fully phased-in pro forma estimates in the previous tables are based on our current understanding of the capital rules and other factors, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from the Federal Reserve and as the interpretation of the regulations evolves over time. These fully phased-in pro forma estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that we consider to be useful measures for us, investors and analysts in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that were not yet effective at December 31, 2016. These preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially and should not be taken as a projection of what our capital, capital ratios, RWAs, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.
Well-Capitalized Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios for U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
 
  	  	At December 31, 2016	 
Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
  	 	6.5%	 
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
  	 	8.0%	 
Total risk-based capital ratio
  	 	10.0%	 
Tier 1 leverage ratio
  	 	5.0%	 
For us to remain a financial holding company, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized by maintaining the minimum ratio requirements set forth in the previous table. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards required for us under the capital rules. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of our risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 2016 would have exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require us to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio
We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratios, which will become effective as a capital standard on January 1, 2018. By January 1, 2018, we must also maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition,
beginning in 2018, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.

Adjustments are to: (i) incorporate derivative exposures, including adding the related potential future exposure (including for derivatives cleared for clients), grossing up cash collateral netting where qualifying criteria are not met and adding the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) reflect the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; (iii) add the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures; and (iv) apply other adjustments to Tier 1 capital, including disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.
Based on our current understanding of the rules and other factors, we estimate our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 6.2% at December 31, 2016 and 5.8% at December 31, 2015. These estimates utilize a fully phased-in Tier 1 capital numerator and a fully phased-in denominator of approximately $1,061.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1,095.6 billion at December 31, 2015, which takes into consideration the Tier 1 capital deductions that would be applicable in 2018 after the phase-in period has ended.

G-SIB Capital Surcharge
We and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIB’s size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (“Method 1”). The second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (“Method 2”) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. Our current G-SIB surcharge is 3%. The surcharge is being phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, and the phase-in amount for 2017 is 50% of the applicable surcharge (see “Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios: Transitional Provisions” herein).
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements
On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for top-tier bank holding companies of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company, that establishes external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements. The final rule contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features, typically associated with certain types of structured notes. Covered BHCs must comply with all requirements under the rule by January 1, 2019, which we expect to accomplish.
The main purpose of the Federal Reserve’s minimum external TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the Parent Company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where a single point of entry (“SPOE”) resolution strategy is used (see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” in Part I, Item 1A).
Under the final rule, a covered BHC is required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to the greater of 18% of total RWAs and 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its supplementary leverage ratio). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of 6% of total RWAs plus the
greater of the Method 1 and Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company and 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.
In addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHC’s Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, as a percentage of total RWAs. The leverage-exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHC’s total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
The final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.
Furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHC’s outstanding external TLAC amount.
Capital Plans and Stress Tests
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework.
We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.
The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution (i.e., payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios. In

addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.
In November 2015, the Federal Reserve amended its capital plan and stress test rules to delay until 2017 the use of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement, defer indefinitely the use of the Advanced Approach risk-based capital framework in capital planning and company-run stress tests, and incorporate the Tier 1 capital deductions for certain investments in Volcker Rule covered funds into the pro forma minimum capital requirements for capital plan and stress testing purposes.
The capital plan rule requires that large bank holding companies receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A bank holding company’s ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.
In addition, we must conduct semiannual company-run stress tests and are subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.
On April 5, 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan, and summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests were published by the Federal Reserve in June. We exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the Federal Reserve severely adverse scenario, and our quantitative capital results improved from our prior-year submission. In June 2016, we received a conditional non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 capital plan (see “Capital Management” herein). On December 29, 2016, we resubmitted our capital plan, as required by the Federal Reserve, to address weaknesses identified in our capital planning process.
Future capital distributions may be restricted if these identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan. Pursuant to the conditional non-objection, we are able to execute the capital actions set forth in our 2016 capital plan, which included increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and executing share repurchases of $3.5 billion during the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. In addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the
Federal Reserve on October 5, 2016, and we disclosed a summary of the results on October 31, 2016.
For the 2017 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017. We expect that the Federal Reserve will provide its response to our 2017 capital plan by June 30, 2017. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large bank holding company, including us, by June 30, 2017. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, we must submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2017 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2017 and November 4, 2017.
In January 2017, the Federal Reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, reduce the de minimis threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserve’s prior approval. The final rule also establishes a “blackout period” beginning in March of each year while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR reviews during which firms are not permitted to submit de minimis exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions. The Federal Reserve is currently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements, which may increase minimum capital requirements for the Firm.
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2016 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2016 and published a summary of their stress test results on June 23, 2016. For the 2017 stress test cycle, MSBNA and MSPBNA must submit their 2017 annual company-run stress tests to the OCC by April 5, 2017 and publish the summary results between June 15, 2017 and July 15, 2017.
Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework
Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. Required Capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the
 
 
 	71	 	December 2016 Form 10-K
Table of Contents

Management’s Discussion and Analysis	 	LOGO
 
risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company equity. We generally hold Parent Company equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.
Effective January 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on our pro forma fully phased-in regulatory capital, including supplementary leverage and stress losses (which results in more capital being attributed to the business segments), whereas prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital provisions. Also, beginning in 2016, the amount of capital allocated to the business segments will be set at the beginning of each year and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset. Differences between available and Required Capital will be attributed to Parent Company equity during the year. Periods prior to 2016 have not been recast under this new methodology.
The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate stress testing or enhancements in modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Regulatory Developments
Resolution and Recovery Planning
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) an annual resolution plan that
describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.
Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. On September 30, 2016, we submitted a status report to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in respect of certain shortcomings identified in our 2015 resolution plan. Pursuant to the status report, we indicated that the Parent Company will amend and restate its support agreement with its material subsidiaries that is designed to ensure that such subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity as and when needed throughout a resolution scenario.
Under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company will be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material subsidiaries.
The obligations of the Parent Company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) will be effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.
Our next full resolution plan submission will be on July 1, 2017. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or, after a two-year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.
In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national banks and certain other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines were effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be in compliance by January 1, 2018.
In May 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that would impose contractual requirements on certain “qualified financial contracts” (“covered QFCs”) to which U.S. G-SIBs,
 
 
December 2016 Form 10-K	 	72

including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. In August 2016, the OCC proposed a rule that would subject national banks that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as certain other institutions (collectively with U.S. G-SIBs and their other subsidiaries, “covered entities”), to substantively identical requirements.
Under the proposals, covered QFCs must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a covered entity are limited to the same extent as provided under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, covered QFCs may not permit the exercise of cross-default rights against a covered entity based on an affiliate’s entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of the first calendar quarter that begins at least one year after the final rules are issued. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposals, which are subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures.
For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in Part I, Item 1.
Legacy Covered Funds under the Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule prohibits “banking entities,” including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions.
Banking entities were required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. The Federal Reserve has extended the conformance period until July 21, 2017 for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place before December 31, 2013, referred to as “legacy covered funds.” The Volcker Rule also permits the Federal Reserve to provide an additional transition period of up to five years for banking entities to conform investments in certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds.
On December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement with information about how banking entities may seek this further statutory extension. Additionally, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects the illiquid funds of banking entities to generally qualify for extensions, although they may not be granted if the banking entity has not demonstrated meaningful progress to conform or divest its illiquid funds, or has a deficient compliance program under the Volcker Rule, or if the Federal Reserve has concerns about evasion. We submitted our application for illiquid funds extension in January 2017, covering essentially all of our approximately $1.9 billion of non-conforming investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.
We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For further information on our lending commitments, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Risk Management—Credit Risk—Lending Activities” in Item 7A.
Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations include long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.

Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates
To the extent that an increased inflation outlook results in rising interest rates or has negative impacts on the valuation of financial instruments that exceed the impact on the value of our liabilities, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability. Rising inflation may also result in increases in our non-interest expenses that may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. Other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates could also impact our results of operations.
A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. For information about cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
Risk Management
Overview
Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure and to facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Firm. Risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. We have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, advise, challenge and control the principal risks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The principal risks involved in our business activities include market (including non-trading interest rate risk), credit, operational, liquidity, model, compliance, strategic and reputational risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our business planning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by our Board of Directors (the “Board”).
The cornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets
requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.
Our risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is willing to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and business plan, taking into account the interest of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capital and financial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board (“BRC”), and the Board on, at least, an annual basis.
Risk Governance Structure
Risk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communication of risk matters across the Firm, to senior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance structure is composed of the Board; the BRC, the Audit Committee of the Board (“BAC”), and the Operations and Technology Committee of the Board (“BOTC”); the Firm Risk Committee (“FRC”); the functional risk and control committees; senior management oversight (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer); the Internal Audit Department and risk managers, committees, and groups within and across the business segments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework, composed of independent but complementary entities, facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.

Morgan Stanley Board of Directors.    The Board has oversight for the ERM framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in a sound manner. The Board has authorized the committees within the ERM framework to help facilitate our risk oversight responsibilities. As set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, the Board also oversees, and receives reports on, our financial performance, strategy and business plans as well as our practices and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct.
Risk Committee of the Board.    The BRC is composed of non-management directors. The BRC oversees our global ERM framework; oversees the major risk exposures of the Firm, including market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, and reputational risk, against established risk measurement methodologies and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; oversees our risk appetite statement, including risk limits and tolerances; reviews capital, liquidity and funding strategy and related guidelines and policies; reviews the contingency funding plan and internal capital adequacy assessment process and capital plan; oversees our significant risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies; oversees the performance of the Chief Risk Officer; reviews reports from our Strategic Transactions Committee, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) Committee, and Resolution and Recovery Planning (“RRP”) Committee; reviews significant reputational risk, franchise risk, new product risk, emerging risks and regulatory matters; and reviews results of Internal Audit reviews and assessment of the risk management, liquidity and capital functions. The BRC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis, coordinates with other Board committees with
respect to oversight of risk management and risk assessment guidelines and the entire Board attends quarterly meetings with the BRC.
Audit Committee of the Board.    The BAC is composed of independent directors. The BAC oversees the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and system of internal controls; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board, BRC and BOTC and reviews the major legal and compliance risk exposures of the Firm and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; selects, determines the fees, evaluates and when appropriate, replaces the independent auditor; oversees the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditor, and pre-approves audit and permitted non-audit services; oversees the performance of our Global Audit Director; and after review, recommends to the Board the acceptance and inclusion of the annual audited consolidated financial statements in the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The BAC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis.
Operations and Technology Committee of the Board.    The BOTC is composed of non-management directors. The BOTC oversees our operations and technology strategy, including trends that may affect such strategy; reviews operations and technology budget and significant expenditures and investments in support of such strategy; reviews operations and technology metrics; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding operations and technology risk; reviews the major operations and technology

risk exposures of the Firm, including information security and cybersecurity risks, and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and oversees our business continuity planning. The BOTC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis.
Firm Risk Committee.    The Board has also authorized the FRC, a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to oversee the global ERM framework. The FRC’s responsibilities include oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits and the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, legal, compliance and reputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate, and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate Firm limits and tolerance, as appropriate. The Governance Process Review Subcommittee of the FRC oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the FRC. The FRC reports to the entire Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer.
Functional Risk and Control Committees.    Functional risk and control committees comprising the ERM framework, including the Firm Credit Risk Committee, the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, the Asset/Liability Management Committee, the Global Compliance Committee, the Technology Governance Committee and the Firm Franchise Committee, facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. The Strategic Transactions Committee reviews large strategic transactions and principal investments for the Firm; the CCAR Committee and oversee our Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing; our RRP Committee oversees our Title I Resolution Plan and Recovery Plan; the Global Legal Entity Oversight and Governance Committee monitors the governance framework that operates over our consolidated legal entity population; the Enterprise Regulatory Oversight Committee oversees significant regulatory and supervisory requirements and assessments; various commitment and underwriting committees are responsible for reviewing capital, lending and underwriting commitments on behalf of us; and the Culture, Values and Conduct Committee oversees Firm-wide standards and initiatives relating to culture, values and conduct, including training and enhancements to performance and compensation processes.
In addition, each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and
systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.
Chief Risk Officer.    The Chief Risk Officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the BRC and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Risk Officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risk limits; independently reviews material market, credit, liquidity, model and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC and the BAC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with the Chief Financial Officer regarding capital and liquidity management and works with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking.
Independent Risk Management Functions.    The independent risk management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk Management Departments) are independent of our business units. These functions assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling our risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the risk management functions may be found below under “Market Risk,” “Credit Risk,” “Operational Risk,” “Model Risk,” and “Liquidity Risk.”
Support and Control Groups.    Our support and control groups include the Legal and Compliance Division, the Finance Division, the Operations Division, the Technology and Data Division, the Human Resources Department, Strategy and Execution, and Corporate Services. Our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; the business segment’s market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks; sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance and regulatory risk; and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review.
Internal Audit Department.    The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the BAC. The Internal Audit Department provides an independent assessment of our control environment and risk

management processes using a risk-based audit coverage model and audit execution methodology developed from professional auditing standards. The Internal Audit Department also reviews and tests our compliance with internal guidelines set for risk management and risk monitoring, as well as external rules and regulations governing the industry. It effects these responsibilities through periodic reviews (with specified minimum frequency) of our processes, activities, products or information systems; targeted reviews of specific controls and activities; pre-implementation or initiative reviews of new or significantly changed processes, activities, products or information systems; and special investigations required as a result of internal factors or regulatory requests. In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Global Audit Director also periodically reports to the BRC and BOTC on risk-related controls.
Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees.    Employees of the Firm are accountable for conducting themselves in accordance with our core values: Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing, Leading with Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back. We are committed to building on our strong culture anchored in these core values, and supported by our governance framework, Board and management oversight, effective risk management and controls, training and development programs, policies, procedures, and defined roles and responsibilities, including the role of the Culture, Values and Conduct Committee. Our Code of Conduct (the “Code”) establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the Firm’s commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every employee annually must certify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code. The employee annual review process includes evaluation of adherence to the Code and our core values. The Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets forth standards for managers when making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. We also have several mutually reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current-year compensation and/or prior-year compensation. Our clawback and cancellation provisions, which permit recovery of deferred incentive compensation, apply to a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission that constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm (including failure to comply with internal compliance, ethics or risk management standards, and failure or refusal to perform duties satisfactorily, including supervisory and management duties), causes a restatement of our consolidated financial results, constitutes a violation of our global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes a loss of revenues associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of internal control policies.
Risk Management Process
The following is a discussion of our risk management policies and procedures for our principal risks (capital and liquidity risk is discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7). The discussion focuses on our securities activities (primarily our institutional trading activities) and corporate lending and related activities. We believe that these activities generate a substantial portion of our principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors described below.
Risk Limits Framework
Risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk-taking. Our risk-taking capacity is sized through the Firm’s capital planning process where losses are estimated under the Firm’s Bank Holding Company Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitative metrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities.
Risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. Board-level risk limits address the most important Firm-wide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to, stressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risk limits approved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and are bound by the higher-level Board risk limits.
Market Risk
Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur trading-related market risk within the Wealth Management business segment. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity

vehicles. Market risk includes non-trading interest rate risk. Non-trading interest rate risk in the banking book (amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book.
Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors our risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis systems. These limits are designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is also monitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors, and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board.
The Chief Risk Officer, among other things, monitors market risk through the Market Risk Department, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is independent of the business units, and has close interactions with senior management and the risk management control groups in the business units. The Chief Risk Officer is a member of the FRC, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, and regularly reports on market risk matters to this committee, as well as to the BRC and the Board.
Sales and Trading and Related Activities
Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management.    During 2016, we had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices—and the associated implied volatilities and spreads—related to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.
We are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in
interest rate-sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets and asset-backed debt (including mortgage-related securities).
We are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions (including positions in non-public entities). Positions in non-public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities.
We are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non-U.S. dollar-denominated financial instruments.
We are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarily to electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production and transportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities.
We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. We manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a Firm-wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. We manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregate risk tolerance as established by our senior management.

Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm across all divisions worldwide. Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by our senior management.
VaR.    We use the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management.
VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations.    We estimate VaR using a model based on volatility-adjusted historical simulation for general market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in corporate shares, bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model constructs a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on the following: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors; and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. Our VaR model uses four years of historical data with a volatility adjustment to reflect current market conditions. VaR for risk management purposes (“Management VaR”) is computed at a 95% level of confidence over a one-day time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The 95%/one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.
Our VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to equity and commodity price risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and non-linear exposures to implied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives).
We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio’s aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However, VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not
limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.
Our VaR model evolves over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR model’s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.
Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one-day VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.
VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms’ portfolios, modeling assumptions and methodologies. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. The impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm’s risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.

We utilize the same VaR model for risk management purposes, as well as for regulatory capital calculations. Our VaR model has been approved by our regulators for use in regulatory capital calculations.
The portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs from that used for regulatory capital requirements (“Regulatory VaR”), as Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR. Examples include counterparty credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.
The following table presents the Management VaR for the Trading portfolio, on a period-end, annual average, and annual high and low basis. To further enhance the transparency of the traded market risk, the Credit Portfolio VaR has been disclosed as a separate category from the Primary Risk Categories. The Credit Portfolio includes counterparty CVA and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.

1.	
Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.
2.	
The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the year, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.
The average total Management VaR for 2016 was $43 million compared with $50 million for 2015. The average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories for 2016 was $36 million compared with $47 million in 2015. The noted decreases were driven by an overall reduction in risk exposures across the Sales and Trading businesses.
Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2016.    One method of evaluating the reasonableness of our VaR model as a measure of our potential volatility of net revenues is to compare VaR with actual trading revenues. Assuming no intraday trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model would be questioned. We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model’s accuracy relative to realized trading results.
The distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues is presented in the following histograms for the Total Trading populations.
Total Trading.    As shown in the 95%/One-Day Management VaR table on the preceding page, the average 95%/one-day total Management VaR for 2016 was $43 million. The following histogram presents the distribution of the daily 95%/one-day total Management VaR for 2016, which was in a range between $30 million and $60 million for approximately 99% of trading days during the year.

The following histogram shows the distribution for 2016 of daily net trading revenues, including profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities, for our Trading businesses. Daily net trading revenues also include intraday trading activities but exclude certain items not captured in the VaR model, such as fees, commissions and net interest income.

differ from the definition of revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting, which further excludes intraday trading. During 2016, we experienced net trading losses on 18 days, of which no day was in excess of the 95%/one-day Total Management VaR.

Non-Trading Risks
We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. Reflected below is this analysis covering substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.
Counterparty Exposure Related to Our Own Credit Spread.    The credit spread risk sensitivity of the counterparty exposure related to our own credit spread corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $6 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Funding Liabilities.    The credit spread risk sensitivity of our mark-to-market funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $17 million and $11 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity.    The following table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity, including our deposit deployment strategy and asset-liability management hedges.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we changed the criteria used to determine the pricing for our deposit liabilities to client cash balances from client assets under management. As a result of the change, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries balance sheet is expected to have greater sensitivity to higher rates than in prior periods.

At December 31, 2016, the upward instantaneous interest rate shocks result in a positive impact to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ projected net interest income over the following 12 months.
We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.
Investments.    We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which are for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance fees.

Equity Market Sensitivity.    In the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, certain fee-based revenue streams are driven by the value of clients’ equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of the equity market decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the impact of such market decline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets.

Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We primarily incur credit risk exposure to institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.
We may incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
•	 	
extending credit to clients through various lending commitments;
 
•	 	
entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us;
 
•	 	
providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount;
 
•	 	
posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties;
 
•	 	
placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations; and
 
•	 	
investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.
We incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
•	 	
margin loans collateralized by securities;
 
•	 	
securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending, to high net worth clients; and
 
•	 	
single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming or home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) form, primarily to existing Wealth Management clients.
Monitoring and Control
In order to help protect us from losses, the Credit Risk Management Department establishes Firm-wide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk exposure at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. The Credit Risk Management Department approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and ensures that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and
borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit risk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the Credit Risk Management Department and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from the Credit Risk Management Department. A comprehensive and global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type.
The Credit Risk Management Department ensures transparency of material credit risks, compliance with established limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. The Credit Risk Management Department also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures and to perform stress tests to identify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising in the lending and trading activities. The stress tests shock market factors (e.g., interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters (e.g., default probabilities and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress and scenario tests are conducted in accordance with our established policies and procedures.
Credit Evaluation
The evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning obligor credit ratings, which reflect an assessment of an obligor’s probability of default and loss given default. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization; access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. The Credit Risk Management Department also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, management and other factors that could affect the obligor’s risk profile. Additionally, the Credit Risk Management Department evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrower’s capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction.
The evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailored to the specific type of lending. Margin and securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan, the degree of leverage and the quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor’s income,

net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and credit bureau information. Subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into the Credit Risk Management Department’s maintenance of the allowance for loan losses for the loans held for the investment portfolio. Such allowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified for impairment. For more information on the allowance for loan losses, see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Risk Mitigation
We may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments that may include single-name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, we may sell, assign or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets. In connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty default. A collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our collateralized transactions.
Lending Activities
We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. In the consolidated balance sheets, these loans and lending commitments are carried at either fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings; held for investment, which are recorded at amortized cost; or held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held for investment and loans held for sale are classified in Loans, and loans held at fair value are classified in Trading assets in the consolidated balance sheets. See Notes 3, 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for all lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
4.	
For syndications led by us, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. For syndications that we participate in and do not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that we expect will be allocated from the lead, syndicate bank. Due to the nature of our obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.

Our credit exposure from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower’s financial strength, seniority of the loan, collateral type, volatility of collateral value, debt cushion, loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio, covenants and counterparty type. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered.
At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses related to loans that were accounted for as held for investment was $274 million and $225 million, respectively, and the allowance for commitment losses related to lending commitments that were accounted for as held for investment was $190 million and $185 million, respectively. The aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses increased over the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the energy sector. See “Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy Industry” herein and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.
Institutional Securities Lending Activities.    In connection with certain of our Institutional Securities business segment activities, we provide loans and lending commitments to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients. These activities include corporate lending, commercial and residential mortgage lending, asset-backed lending, corporate loans purchased in the secondary market, financing extended to equities and commodities customers, and loans to municipalities. These loans and lending commitments may have varying terms; may be senior or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by us.
We also participate in securitization activities whereby we extend short-term or long-term funding to clients through loans and lending commitments that are secured by the assets of the borrower and generally provide for over-collateralization. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about our securitization activities.
Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments are mainly related to relationship-based and event-driven lending to select corporate clients. Relationship-based loans and lending commitments are used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity purposes by our investment banking clients and typically consist of revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and term loans. In
connection with the relationship-based lending activities, we had hedges (which included single-name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $20.2 billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization and project finance activities. Event-driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate amount of investment grade loans was $15.3 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively, the aggregate amount of non-investment grade loans was $24.7 billion and $26.9 billion, respectively, and the aggregate amount of unrated loans was $2.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.
At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 99% of the Institutional Securities business segment loans held for investment were current, while approximately 1% were on nonaccrual status because the loans were past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest was in doubt.

Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy Industry.    At December 31, 2016, Institutional Securities’ loans and lending commitments related to the energy industry were $11.8 billion, of which approximately
68% are accounted for as held for investment and 32% are accounted for as either held for sale or at fair value. Additionally, approximately 52% of the total energy industry loans and lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. At December 31, 2016, the energy industry portfolio included $1.3 billion in loans and $2.1 billion in lending commitments to Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (“E&P”) companies.
The E&P loans were to non-investment grade counterparties, which are generally subject to periodic borrowing base reassessments based on the value of the underlying oil and gas reserves pledged as collateral. In limited situations, we may extend the period related to borrowing base reassessments typically in conjunction with taking certain risk mitigating actions with the borrower. Approximately 54% of the E&P lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we increased the allowance for loan and commitment losses on held for investment energy exposures and incurred mark-to-market losses related to energy loans and lending commitments. See “Credit Risk—Lending Activities” herein for further information. To the extent commodities prices, or oil prices, remain at year-end levels, or deteriorate further, we may incur additional lending losses.
Institutional Securities Margin Lending.    In addition to the activities noted above, Institutional Securities provides margin lending, which allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin lending were $11.9 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.
Wealth Management Lending Activities.    The principal Wealth Management lending activities include securities-based lending and residential real estate loans.
Securities-based lending provided to our retail clients is primarily conducted through our Portfolio Loan Account (“PLA”) and Liquidity Access Line (“LAL”) platforms, which had an outstanding loan balance of $29.7 billion and $24.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These loans allow the client to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any purpose other than purchasing securities. We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities and monitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the right to not make any advances, or may terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the client’s credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateral diversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral.

Residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including HELOC loans. Our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores), debt ratios and assets of the borrower. Loan-to-value ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. The vast majority of mortgage and HELOC loans are held for investment in the Wealth Management business segment’s loan portfolio.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, loans and lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment lending activities increased by approximately 24%, mainly due to growth in LAL and residential real estate loans.

At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately 99.9% of the Wealth Management business segment loans held for investment were current, while approximately 0.1% were on nonaccrual status because the loans were past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest was in doubt.
The Wealth Management business segment also provides margin lending to clients and had an outstanding balance of
$12.5 billion and $14.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, the Wealth Management business segment has employee loans of $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that are granted in conjunction with programs established by us to retain and recruit certain employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are full recourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. We establish an allowance for loan amounts we do not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense.
Credit Exposure—Derivatives
We incur credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. In connection with our OTC derivative activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master netting agreement in the event of counterparty default. We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). For credit exposure information on our OTC derivative products, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Credit Derivatives.    A credit derivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of the following defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructurings.
We trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. In transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of

exposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, we work to earn a bid-offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of our credit default swap (“CDS”) protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS.
We actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are composed of banks, broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. As with all derivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize credit valuation adjustments as appropriate within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements.

Our CDSs are classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Approximately 4% and 3%, respectively, of receivable fair values and 7% and 6%, respectively, of payable fair values represented Level 3 amounts at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
The fair values shown in the previous table are before the application of contractual netting or collateral. For additional credit exposure information on our credit derivative portfolio, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Country Risk Exposure
Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. Country risk exposure before and after hedging is monitored and managed.
Our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures whereby an obligor has vulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction and finance company subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures identified through the credit evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk.

We conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and market exposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects. Second order risks such as the impact for core European banks of their peripheral exposures may also be considered. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation.
In addition to our country risk exposure, we disclose our cross-border risk exposure in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Financial Data Supplement (Unaudited)” in Item 8. It is based on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represents the amounts that we may not be able to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies.
There can be substantial differences between our country risk exposure and cross-border risk exposure. For instance, unlike the cross-border risk exposure, our country risk exposure includes the effect of certain risk mitigants. In addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the country risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the cross-border risk exposure. Cross-border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. For country risk exposure, we consider factors in
addition to that of country of jurisdiction, including physical location of operations or assets, location and source of cash flows/revenues and location of collateral (if applicable) in order to determine the basis for country risk exposure. Furthermore, cross-border risk exposure incorporates CDS only where protection is purchased, while country risk exposure incorporates CDS where protection is purchased or sold.
Our sovereign exposures consist of financial instruments entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures consist of exposures to primarily corporations and financial institutions. The following table shows our 10 largest non-U.S. country risk net exposures at December 31, 2016. Index credit derivatives are included in the country risk exposure table. Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity’s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable/payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure column based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable/payable is reflected in the Net Inventory column based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions (i.e., bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable). As a market maker, we may transact in these CDS positions to facilitate client trading. At December 31, 2016, gross purchased protection, gross written protection, and net exposures related to single-name and index credit derivatives for those countries were $(85.3) billion, $83.7 billion and $(1.6) billion, respectively. For a further description of the triggers for purchased credit protection and whether those triggers may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see “Credit Exposure—Derivatives” herein.
2.	
Net counterparty exposure (i.e., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) takes into consideration legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.
3.	
At December 31, 2016, the benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure was $9.5 billion in the U.K., with 96% of collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.K., U.S. and France, and $6.6 billion in Japan with nearly all collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of Japan. The benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure in the other countries totaled approximately $10.6 billion, with collateral primarily consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.S. These amounts do not include collateral received on secured financing transactions.
4.	
Amounts represent CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures for us. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable.
5.	
In addition, at December 31, 2016, we had exposure to these countries for overnight deposits with banks of approximately $10.2 billion.

Country Risk Exposures Related to the United Kingdom.    At December 31, 2016, our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $14,702 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits of $5,514 million. The $16,168 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors. Of this exposure, $14,161 million is to investment grade counterparties, with the largest single component ($4,408 million) to exchanges and clearinghouses.
Country Risk Exposures Related to Brazil.    At December 31, 2016, our country risk exposures in Brazil included net exposures of $5,215 million (shown in the previous table). Our sovereign net exposures in Brazil were principally in the form of local currency government bonds held onshore to support client activity. The $582 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors.
Country Risk Exposures Related to China.    At December 31, 2016, our country risk exposures in China included net exposures of $2,075 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits with international banks of $159 million. The $2,269 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to non-sovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors and were primarily concentrated in high-quality positions with negligible direct exposure to onshore equities.
Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). On March 4, 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) updated its proposal for calculating operational risk regulatory capital. Under the proposal, which would eliminate the use of an internal model-based approach, required levels of operational risk regulatory capital would generally be determined under a standardized approach based primarily on a financial statement-based measure of operational risk exposure and adjustments based on the particular institution’s historic operational loss record. The revised proposal will be subject to further rulemaking procedures and its timing has not been specified.
We have established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the Firm. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the Firm and to respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. We have implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, to assess business environment and internal control factors and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment and internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario analysis process.
In addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and mitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These include a strong governance framework, a comprehensive risk management program and insurance. Operational risks and associated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk tolerance established by the Board and are prioritized accordingly. The breadth and range of operational risk are such that the types of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of activities include enhancing defenses against cyberattacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to transfer and/or limit operational risk exposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; technology change management controls; exception management processing controls; and segregation of duties.
Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers therein. The business managers maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business segments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to our senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with our senior management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger; joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; or creation of a new legal entity, a new product or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented.

The Operational Risk Department is independent of the divisions and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Operational Risk Department provides oversight of operational risk management and independently assesses, measures and monitors operational risk. The Operational Risk Department works with the divisions and control groups to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Firm. The Operational Risk Department scope includes oversight of the technology and data risk management program (e.g., cybersecurity), fraud risk management and prevention program, and supplier risk management (vendor risk oversight and assessment) program. Furthermore, the Operational Risk Department supports the collection and reporting of operational risk incidents and the execution of operational risk assessments; provides the infrastructure needed for risk measurement and risk management; and ensures ongoing validation and verification of our advanced measurement approach for operational risk capital.
Business Continuity Management is responsible for identifying key risks and threats to our resiliency and planning to ensure that a recovery strategy and required resources are in place for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a Firm-wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of our Business Continuity Management Program include: crisis management; business recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing.
We maintain an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and is designed to address regulatory requirements. Information security policies are designed to protect our information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These policies cover a broad range of areas, including: application entitlements, data protection, incident response, internet and electronic communications, remote access, mobile banking products, and portable devices. We have also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect our computers and other assets from unauthorized access.
In connection with our ongoing operations, we utilize the services of external vendors, which we anticipate will continue and may increase in the future. These services include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and other professional services. We manage our exposures to these services through a variety of means such as the performance of due diligence, consideration of operational risk, implementation of service level and other contrac-
tual agreements, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors’ performance. We maintain a supplier risk management program with policies, procedures, organization, governance and supporting technology that satisfies regulatory requirements. The program is designed to ensure that adequate risk management controls over the services exist, including, but not limited to, information security, operational failure, financial stability, disaster recoverability, reputational risk, safeguards against corruption and termination.
Model Risk
Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to a Firm’s reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy.
Sound model risk management is an integral part of our Risk Management Framework. Model Risk Management is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the independent oversight of model risk. It is independent of the business units and reports to the Chief Risk Officer.
The Model Risk Management Department establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our risk appetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage due to errors in design, implementation, and/or inappropriate use of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specific and aggregate business-level assessments, which are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors.
A guiding principle for managing model risk is the “effective challenge” of models. The effective challenge of models is represented by the critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate changes. The Model Risk Management Department provides effective challenge of models, independently validates and approves models for use, annually recertifies models, reports identified model validation limitations to key stakeholders, tracks remediation plans for model validation limitations, and reports on model risk metrics. The department also develops controls to support a complete and accurate Firm-wide model inventory. The Model Risk Management Department reports on our model risk relative to risk tolerance and presents these reports to the Model Oversight Committee, the FRC, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer also provides quarterly updates to the BRC on model risk metrics.

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incur liquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities.
Our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk Department is a distinct area in Risk Management responsible for the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department is independent of the business units and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency of material liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department establishes limits in line with our risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the methodologies and assumptions underpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios. The liquidity and funding risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Liquidity Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board, as appropriate.
The Treasury Department and applicable business units have primary responsibility for evaluating, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our business activities, and for maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Department coordinates with the Treasury Department and these business units to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm.

Legal and Compliance Risk
Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules and regulations. We are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A). We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industry presents a continuing business challenge for us.
